 0:00:27.420,0:00:31.439
 players I really am I love playing in
 0:00:29.609,0:00:33.690
 semi-finals didn't play in the Champions
 0:00:31.439,0:00:35.969
 League semi-final - but you find out
 0:00:33.690,0:00:38.370
 about yourself in the semi-final can you
 0:00:35.969,0:00:40.290
 control your emotions can you commit to
 0:00:38.370,0:00:42.490
 the game plan we're just about to find
 0:00:40.290,0:00:44.150
 out very very excited
 0:00:42.490,0:00:47.730
 [Applause]
 0:00:44.150,0:00:48.470
 [Music]
 0:00:47.730,0:01:12.380
 [Applause]
 0:00:48.470,0:01:15.160
 [Music]
 0:01:12.380,0:01:20.250
 [Applause]
 0:01:15.160,0:01:22.860
 [Music]
 0:01:20.250,0:01:25.620
 you'll see Kappa is given the green
 0:01:22.860,0:01:27.540
 lights in goal Antonio r√ºdiger starts
 0:01:25.620,0:01:30.020
 with andreas Kristensen in central
 0:01:27.540,0:01:32.820
 defence and gato Conte starts alongside
 0:01:30.020,0:01:34.980
 Giorgio in the centre of midfield and
 0:01:32.820,0:01:37.110
 the idea is to have just the one striker
 0:01:34.980,0:01:38.140
 up there trying to pose problems for the
 0:01:37.110,0:01:43.380
 opposition
 0:01:38.140,0:01:45.540
 [Applause]
 0:01:43.380,0:01:47.369
 Stamford Bridge certainly far from the
 0:01:45.540,0:01:48.869
 largest stadium in Europe but I'll tell
 0:01:47.369,0:01:49.530
 you what I really enjoy about coming
 0:01:48.869,0:01:51.210
 here Lee
 0:01:49.530,0:01:53.040
 the fact that it's right in the
 0:01:51.210,0:01:54.780
 neighborhood right in amongst the houses
 0:01:53.040,0:01:56.909
 in West London yeah it is and I think
 0:01:54.780,0:01:58.890
 I've played it many times before it got
 0:01:56.909,0:02:01.619
 renovated in 98 and it wasn't a
 0:01:58.890,0:02:03.690
 particular salud rias Stadium for sure
 0:02:01.619,0:02:05.759
 it was a bit rundown etc but it was a
 0:02:03.690,0:02:07.440
 place always had good results here now
 0:02:05.759,0:02:12.540
 it's a lot lot better and they're still
 0:02:07.440,0:02:14.790
 improving it here as they buy inside the
 0:02:12.540,0:02:17.370
 highly regarded Manuel Neuer start
 0:02:14.790,0:02:19.920
 single David Alaba plays with Jerome
 0:02:17.370,0:02:22.260
 Boateng in central defence Thomas Muller
 0:02:19.920,0:02:24.300
 starts with Serge Ginobili on the blacks
 0:02:22.260,0:02:26.040
 I'm leading the attack today is the
 0:02:24.300,0:02:35.670
 lethal Robert Lewandowski
 0:02:26.040,0:02:37.800
 [Applause]
 0:02:35.670,0:02:39.970
 Conte
 0:02:37.800,0:02:43.030

 0:02:39.970,0:02:43.980
 and they continue to advance and a lot
 0:02:43.030,0:02:46.300
 of options here
 0:02:43.980,0:02:50.740
 [Applause]
 0:02:46.300,0:02:53.080
 and the cross comes to nothing well no

 matter the year when it comes to the
 0:02:53.080,0:02:58.120
 Champions League you tend to expect Li
 0:02:55.270,0:03:00.520
 that Bayern will be there or thereabouts
 0:02:58.120,0:03:01.720
 well a certain word spring to mind when
 0:03:00.520,0:03:05.410
 you think of Bayern Munich over the
 0:03:01.720,0:03:07.180
 years power winners talent and nothing
 0:03:05.410,0:03:10.990
 changes every year they keep producing

 back for his team and the cross is very
 0:03:39.380,0:03:44.760
 much on not to be in terms of the course
 0:03:43.040,0:03:50.870

 Virginia

 0:06:33.270,0:06:36.770
 [Applause]
 0:06:38.459,0:06:45.620
 Thiago Alfonso Davies went in strongly

 decisively
 0:06:45.620,0:06:49.380
 [Applause]
 0:06:47.310,0:06:53.600
 we're not the official word there will
 0:06:49.380,0:06:53.600
 be a minimum of two sanded minutes
 0:06:54.530,0:06:57.530
 counting
 0:06:57.590,0:07:03.470
 chelsey getting the ball forward what
 0:06:59.960,0:07:06.200
 can they do from this position we block
 0:07:03.470,0:07:09.100
 but he's got to get renovates and
 0:07:06.200,0:07:14.540
 no-nonsense defensive clearance
 0:07:09.100,0:07:16.730
 [Applause]
 0:07:14.540,0:07:20.020
 the first 45 minutes have come and gone
 0:07:16.730,0:07:20.020
 here at Stamford Bridge
 0:07:21.240,0:07:24.750
 a man who's never far away from the
 0:07:23.220,0:07:27.509
 headlines I'm referring of course to
 0:07:24.750,0:07:29.819
 robert levansky but as he offers it
 0:07:27.509,0:07:31.740
 awfully well no goals through him no
 0:07:29.819,0:07:33.720
 real chances either he needs to help his
 0:07:31.740,0:07:35.789
 team a little bit more just to get
 0:07:33.720,0:07:38.990
 involved in the game I think he would be
 0:07:35.789,0:07:38.990
 the difference if he was playing better
 0:07:56.820,0:08:03.460
 second half of this Champions League
 0:07:59.470,0:08:06.410
 semi-final first leg underway
 0:08:03.460,0:08:09.610
 Leon go ahead Scott
 0:08:06.410,0:08:09.610

 0:08:13.919,0:08:19.220
 there is William
 0:08:16.470,0:08:22.310
 counting
 0:08:19.220,0:08:24.260
 it's Khanum Hudson annoy a speeding quiz
 0:08:22.310,0:08:27.130
 a nap
 0:08:24.260,0:08:27.130
 Kristensen
 0:08:27.360,0:08:31.009
 this is a speedy quitter
 0:08:34.460,0:08:40.220
 Ksenia Chelsea finding forward gears can
 0:08:38.510,0:08:42.270
 they take advantage of this promising
 0:08:40.220,0:08:45.620
 position
 0:08:42.270,0:08:45.620
 just cutting off the supply
 0:08:48.460,0:08:57.700
 he's in control of the situation live
 0:08:51.700,0:09:01.050
 and offski hereis Tiago Davis they just
 0:08:57.700,0:09:01.050
 let his opponent fly by
 0:09:01.570,0:09:07.529
 at the far past and the defender finding
 0:09:05.800,0:09:12.170
 a solution to the problem
 0:09:07.529,0:09:14.730
 Chozen yo on the ball as beanie quitter
 0:09:12.170,0:09:20.399
 [Applause]
 0:09:14.730,0:09:23.339
 Willian real chance a one-on-one
 0:09:20.399,0:09:25.500
 situation and the goalkeeper prevails in
 0:09:23.339,0:09:27.269
 the dual advantage he's always with the
 0:09:25.500,0:09:28.709
 attacking player because he's got the
 0:09:27.269,0:09:30.390
 ball you've got to take the ball off him
 0:09:28.709,0:09:37.049
 he does a brilliant job on that occasion
 0:09:30.390,0:09:37.049
 [Applause]

 0:11:04.330,0:11:09.660

 0:11:06.730,0:11:11.970
 ideal situation for them
 0:11:09.660,0:11:13.480
 and they have elected to go to the bench
