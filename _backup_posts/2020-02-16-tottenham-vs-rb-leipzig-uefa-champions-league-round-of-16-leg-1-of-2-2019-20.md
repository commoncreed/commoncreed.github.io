Tottenham vs RB Leipzig  
UEFA Champions League &#124; Round of 16 &#124; Leg 1 of 2 &#124; 2019/20  
Stadium : Tottenham Hotspur Stadium 

This will be the first encounter between Tottenham and RB Leipzig. It’s also the first time the team from Leipzig is facing an English club in a competitive fixture whilst Spurs will be facing German opposition in the UCL round of 16 for the second consecutive season, after knocking out Borussia Dortmund 4-0 on aggregate in 2018/19. 

The only previous game between Tottenham and a German team at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium ended in a 7-2 win for Bayern Munich, back in October this season. 

In fact, Tottenham’s two Champions League games against German opposition this season have produced 13 goals. Finalists in 2018/19, Tottenham are in the knockout stages of the Champions League for the third consecutive season – they had only made it past the group phase once before (2010/11). 

RB Leipzig have reached the Champions League knockout stages for the first time in their history. Wolfsburg are the last German team – outside of Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund – to make it past the round of 16, back in 2015/16. 

Tottenham conceded 14 goals in this season’s Champions League group phase, the highest tally among the remaining teams in the competition. Half of those goals came in their home game against Bayern Munich (2-7).

 0:01:20.560,0:01:26.680
 starting a lemon velocity plea they love
 0:01:24.460,0:01:28.750
 to apply almost suffocating pressure
 0:01:26.680,0:01:30.430
 based on the line up do you expect the
 0:01:28.750,0:01:32.259
 same approach today yeah I think so
 0:01:30.430,0:01:33.790
 Derek it makes it really difficult for
 0:01:32.259,0:01:36.070
 the opponents to find their rhythm
 0:01:33.790,0:01:38.259
 unless their torch is absolutely perfect
 0:01:36.070,0:01:41.880
 and forces mistakes so I'd expect we'll
 0:01:38.259,0:01:41.880
 be seeing plenty of that from them today
 0:01:43.720,0:01:48.580
 I must say the old White Hart Lane Lee
 0:01:45.880,0:01:50.860
 was a special place for so many fans but
 0:01:48.580,0:01:53.160
 this is state-of-the-art this new brand
 0:01:50.860,0:01:55.600
 Wow as simple as that it's just
 0:01:53.160,0:01:57.400
 absolutely astonishing what they've done
 0:01:55.600,0:01:59.800
 here and I think they've added a few
 0:01:57.400,0:02:01.900
 more seats just to get the capacity over
 0:01:59.800,0:02:04.290
 the Arsenal ground which pains me a
 0:02:01.900,0:02:04.290
 little bit
 0:02:04.330,0:02:08.440
 and let's have a look at the starting
 0:02:05.920,0:02:10.600
 eleven for light see
 0:02:08.440,0:02:12.520
 it looks like a conventional 442 I
 0:02:10.600,0:02:14.560
 preferred formation by arsene wenger
 0:02:12.520,0:02:17.440
 when he arrived at Arsenal two main
 0:02:14.560,0:02:19.240
 strikers for across the midfield really
 0:02:17.440,0:02:22.750
 important for the full-backs to link up
 0:02:19.240,0:02:25.960
 with the wide midfielders in this system
 0:02:22.750,0:02:29.550

 0:06:41.030,0:06:44.270

 0:06:42.860,0:06:46.310
 they've done brilliantly well to get to
 0:06:44.270,0:06:48.590
 this semi-final can they just push
 0:06:46.310,0:06:51.230
 themselves up one step further and get
 0:06:48.590,0:06:53.510
 to that illustrious final
 0:06:51.230,0:06:56.150

 the fore in this game League or no goals
 0:07:19.660,0:07:23.200
 through him no real chances either he
 0:07:21.430,0:07:25.690
 needs to help his team a little bit more
 0:07:23.200,0:07:27.010
 just to get involved in the game I think
 0:07:25.690,0:07:29.460
 he would be the difference if he was
 0:07:27.010,0:07:29.460
 playing better

 the referee sport of the infringement
 0:10:04.310,0:10:10.610

 0:12:30.540,0:12:37.619
 genuine potential but it's broken town
 0:12:33.980,0:12:41.540

 0:12:37.619,0:12:43.889
 referee producer card and the offense
 0:12:41.540,0:12:44.670

 to be careful now
 0:12:54.080,0:12:59.090
 and as his substitution time at this
 0:12:56.450,0:13:00.480
