 0:00:09.599,0:00:13.590
 night for football the floodlights
 0:00:11.219,0:00:15.809
 shining down on the players as we speak
 0:00:13.590,0:00:18.000

 semi-final of the Champions League
 0:00:21.660,0:00:25.769
 coming up for you I can't wait for this
 0:00:24.090,0:00:28.080
 Lee Thank You Derrick there's no such
 0:00:25.769,0:00:30.029
 thing as a small semi-final every
 0:00:28.080,0:00:32.610
 semi-final and every Cup competition
 0:00:30.029,0:00:34.950
 carries pressure pressure effects both
 0:00:32.610,0:00:37.110
 sets of players the visitors coming here
 0:00:34.950,0:00:39.780
 as big favorites the home team's got
 0:00:37.110,0:00:42.100
 nothing to lose have a go big kariv
 0:00:39.780,0:00:44.600
 beyond the final
 0:00:42.100,0:00:48.040
 [Applause]
 0:00:44.600,0:00:48.900
 [Music]
 0:00:48.040,0:01:12.820
 [Applause]
 0:00:48.900,0:01:15.610

 0:01:12.820,0:01:20.140
 [Applause]
 0:01:15.610,0:01:20.140
 [Music]
 0:01:20.650,0:01:26.260
 Olympique Lyonnais Anthony Lopez begins
 0:01:23.320,0:01:28.530
 in go mal Sal starts with Kenny Guetta
 0:01:26.260,0:01:31.780
 in the fallback positions Luca tessaro's
 0:01:28.530,0:01:33.940
 with who send a ward in central midfield
 0:01:31.780,0:01:35.980
 and the idea is to have just the one
 0:01:33.940,0:01:39.060
 striker up there trying to pose problems
 0:01:35.980,0:01:39.060
 for the opposition
 0:02:03.890,0:02:09.890
 let's have a look at the initial 11 for
 0:02:06.470,0:02:11.870
 the visitors Paul for two but will the
 0:02:09.890,0:02:13.340
 emphasis on attack you're very much so
 0:02:11.870,0:02:16.100
 Derek the number 10 will supply the
 0:02:13.340,0:02:18.110
 support for the strikers three very very
 0:02:16.100,0:02:20.180
 narrow midfield players will also get
 0:02:18.110,0:02:22.520
 forward a little bit worried about the
 0:02:20.180,0:02:23.990
 full-backs expose on that side they need
 0:02:22.520,0:02:26.350
 to be on their game when they don't have
 0:02:23.990,0:02:26.350
 the ball
 0:02:32.440,0:02:38.400
 and it's worth denier on the ball Marcel
 0:02:35.640,0:02:41.670
 it's worth to sir
 0:02:38.400,0:02:41.670
 possession lost
 0:02:45.490,0:02:52.980
 Deanna ch Khedira must say this looks
 0:02:50.860,0:02:55.970
 promising
 0:02:52.980,0:02:55.970
 beautiful pass
 0:02:57.280,0:03:07.380
 on and on he goes crossing opportunity
 0:03:02.250,0:03:07.380
 Cristiano Ronaldo now they've lost it
 0:03:12.100,0:03:17.690
 egg ye
 0:03:13.880,0:03:18.290
 big wine Madrid oh and back with egg
 0:03:17.690,0:03:20.390
 wine
 0:03:18.290,0:03:22.880
 [Applause]
 0:03:20.390,0:03:25.660
 I'm cleared behind for what is going to
 0:03:22.880,0:03:25.660
 be a corner kick
 0:03:31.270,0:03:34.839
 [Applause]
 0:03:40.200,0:03:48.209
 [Applause]
 0:03:41.610,0:03:48.209
 they favored a short one here be an itch
 0:03:48.930,0:03:55.500
 a quite serious miscue in terms of the
 0:03:53.459,0:03:57.420
 strike easy for the keeper now he won't
 0:03:55.500,0:03:59.250
 have an easiest shot to say today that
 0:03:57.420,0:04:01.549
 was really all for finishing from the
 0:03:59.250,0:04:01.549
 attacker
 0:04:04.910,0:04:08.420
 [Applause]
 0:04:06.160,0:04:11.800
 flowering
 0:04:08.420,0:04:11.800
 and now Kenny Chetan
 0:04:14.330,0:04:18.790
 and it was in the right place to
 0:04:16.040,0:04:18.790
 intercept
 0:04:20.690,0:04:24.510
 there's gonna be disappointed with that
 0:04:22.430,0:04:27.730
 pass
 0:04:24.510,0:04:27.730
 [Applause]
 0:04:28.639,0:04:35.319
 sir it's with our Tiago Mendes 
 0:04:35.460,0:04:38.360
 Mendes
 0:04:38.620,0:04:43.460
 they cook the cavity mates
 0:04:40.570,0:04:45.460

 sneak passing confidence on the ball
 0:04:49.030,0:04:55.370
 [Applause]
 0:04:51.110,0:04:55.370
 and he did what he had to do defensively
 0:04:55.860,0:04:59.780
 and they'll get ready for the throw away
 0:05:07.250,0:05:15.090
 now ten ballet it's worth to saw its
 0:05:12.830,0:05:18.780
 brookmont Ontario
 0:05:15.090,0:05:23.400
 Tiago Mendes but some up the ball and
 0:05:18.780,0:05:25.290
 the decision is one of ops I hear below
 0:05:23.400,0:05:28.910
 it is a Gurney's just a little bit too
 0:05:25.290,0:05:28.910
 eager needs to hold his run a little
 0:05:40.250,0:05:49.230
 that drop trou ray has it Tiago Mendes
 0:05:44.680,0:05:53.810
 trouser the lift
 0:05:49.230,0:05:53.810
 illegal play and hence a free kick
 0:05:55.080,0:06:00.300
 [Applause]
 0:06:07.460,0:06:10.750
 [Applause]

 [Applause]
 0:06:29.360,0:06:33.660
 [Applause]
 0:06:31.160,0:06:35.550
 quite to enough
 0:06:33.660,0:06:37.650
 and the keeper has custody of the ball
 0:06:35.550,0:06:39.630
 but just a few seconds beforehand
 0:06:37.650,0:06:41.310
 he had a big save to make well keep hold
 0:06:39.630,0:06:43.650
 of the other breather because that first
 0:06:41.310,0:06:44.570
 save deserves us all to look at him and
 0:06:43.650,0:06:51.890

 well how often do we say this Cristiano
 0:08:12.130,0:08:16.000
 Ronaldo has struggled to get into the

 game not really making much of an impact
 0:08:16.000,0:08:20.169

 0:10:15.990,0:10:22.080
