PSG vs Dortmund  
UEFA Champions League | Round of 16 | Leg 2 of 2 | 2019/20  
Stadium : Parc des Princes 

The only previous encounter between Borussia Dortmund and Paris SG was in the 2010/11 Europa League group stages – both games ended in a draw (1-1 in Dortmund, 0-0 in Paris). 

Borussia Dortmund have always scored at least two goals in their six Champions League home games against French clubs. However, among the 16 teams qualified for this season’s knockout phase, no team scored fewer goals in the group stages (8). 

Borussia Dortmund have made it past the Champions League round of 16 only once in the last five seasons. It was in 2016/17 under current Paris SG manager Thomas Tuchel – they were eventually knocked out by Monaco in the quarter-finals. 

Borussia Dortmund have lost four of their last six Champions League home games in the knockout phase (W2), including the last two (2-3 v Monaco in 2016/17, 0-1 v Tottenham in 2018/19). 

Borussia Dortmund’s last 22 goals in the Champions League have all come from open play, the longest current run among the remaining sides in the competition.

 0:14:41.140,0:14:45.940
 rightly so sometimes semi-finals can be
 0:14:44.080,0:14:48.220
 a little bit too much for players one
 0:14:45.940,0:14:50.500
 side has to lose one side goes to the
 0:14:48.220,0:14:52.510

 0:15:47.810,0:15:52.840
 for defenders defend goalkeepers make
 0:15:50.270,0:15:52.840
 saves like
 0:15:57.370,0:16:01.360
