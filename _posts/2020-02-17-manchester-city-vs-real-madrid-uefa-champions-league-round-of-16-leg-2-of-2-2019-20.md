 0:11:30.400,0:11:32.920
 should be there probably would have been
 0:11:32.260,0:11:35.140
 my fault
 0:11:32.920,0:11:37.510
 on that occasion his defenders went
 0:11:35.140,0:11:39.870
 missing let's have another view of that
 0:11:37.510,0:11:39.870
 goal
 0:11:45.650,0:11:49.910
 well the manager knows the importance of
 0:11:47.839,0:11:51.470
 that goal he also knows that you're at
 0:11:49.910,0:11:53.860
 your most vulnerable just after you've
 0:11:51.470,0:11:53.860
 scored
 0:12:00.399,0:12:04.510

 0:14:11.020,0:14:15.550
 look at the celebrations and quite
 0:14:12.580,0:14:17.410
 rightly so sometimes semi-finals can be
 0:14:15.550,0:14:19.690
 a little bit too much for players one
 0:14:17.410,0:14:21.970
 side has to lose one side goes to the
 0:14:19.690,0:14:23.980
 final I'm very envious of those players
 0:14:21.970,0:14:25.810
 look at them enjoying this moment still
 0:14:23.980,0:14:29.100
 work to be done before they peak that

 0:14:52.150,0:14:57.040
 second leg of this Champions League
 0:14:53.980,0:14:59.280
 semi-final opportunity to deliver the
 0:14:57.040,0:14:59.280
 cross
 0:15:01.320,0:15:05.700
 it just over the bar yeah he thinks he's
 0:15:03.960,0:15:12.650
 in he thinks he's scored and he's just
 0:15:05.700,0:15:12.650
 over the bar he continues to make hay
