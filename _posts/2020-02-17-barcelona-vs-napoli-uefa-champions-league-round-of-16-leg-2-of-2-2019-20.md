 0:00:11.639,0:00:15.150
 name's Derek ray and joining me for
 0:00:13.410,0:00:17.220
 commentary on this game is the former
 0:00:15.150,0:00:20.070
 Arsenal and England fullback Lee Dixon
 0:00:17.220,0:00:22.380
 and Barcelona know full well they have a
 0:00:20.070,0:00:24.510
 lot of work to do in the second and
 0:00:22.380,0:00:27.599
 decisive leg of this Champions League
 0:00:24.510,0:00:29.760
 semi-final its Barcelona up against
 0:00:27.599,0:00:32.189
 Napoli while the visitors played really
 0:00:29.760,0:00:34.410
 well in the home leg gaining that small
 0:00:32.189,0:00:36.090
 lead well this is a different story away
 0:00:34.410,0:00:37.980
 from their ground away from their fans
 0:00:36.090,0:00:41.520
 who knows how they're going to react
 0:00:37.980,0:00:44.360
 really excited about this one Derek
 0:00:41.520,0:00:47.460
 [Applause]
 0:00:44.360,0:00:48.220
 [Music]
 0:00:47.460,0:01:16.740
 [Applause]
 0:00:48.220,0:01:17.640
 [Music]
 0:01:16.740,0:01:19.080
 [Applause]
 0:01:17.640,0:01:32.119
 [Music]
 0:01:19.080,0:01:32.119
 [Applause]
 0:01:41.100,0:01:46.320
 [Applause]
 0:01:43.290,0:01:49.530
 looks like this mark and racist against
 0:01:46.320,0:01:51.840
 Dotson go pee K starts alongside Clemen
 0:01:49.530,0:01:53.520
 log lay in the center of defense and the
 0:01:51.840,0:01:55.810
 defenders have better be on the terms
 0:01:53.520,0:02:00.249
 because leading the line is Luis Suarez
 0:01:55.810,0:02:00.249
 [Applause]
 0:02:02.040,0:02:05.159
 [Music]
 0:02:06.040,0:02:11.110
 a glance at the Napoli side well there's
 0:02:09.130,0:02:13.180
 no great mystery is there we know
 0:02:11.110,0:02:15.610
 normally how they're going to play and
 0:02:13.180,0:02:18.280
 it's all about applying as much pressure
 0:02:15.610,0:02:19.870
 as possible Lee can we anticipate seeing
 0:02:18.280,0:02:21.970
 more of the same today yeah absolutely
 0:02:19.870,0:02:23.710
 Derek if you're really good at something
 0:02:21.970,0:02:25.900
 then why not they're very good at this
 0:02:23.710,0:02:28.630
 all the team members have bought into
 0:02:25.900,0:02:30.650
 this style of play one player slacks off
 0:02:28.630,0:02:33.160
 and it all falls apart
 0:02:30.650,0:02:36.060
 [Applause]
 0:02:33.160,0:02:36.060
 and away by Barcelona

 no worries for the keeper
 0:03:09.660,0:03:15.720

 and here's Alan Neely now Kerry horn and
 0:03:26.630,0:03:32.380
 you need your defender to take charge
 0:03:29.730,0:03:35.590
 [Applause]
 0:03:32.380,0:03:35.590
 too young
 0:03:36.230,0:03:41.480
 Jordi Alba
 0:03:38.400,0:03:41.480
 whose guess
 0:03:47.370,0:03:50.000

 0:04:12.600,0:04:15.590
 [Applause]
 0:04:14.660,0:04:18.260
 the keeper would have been disappointed
 0:04:15.590,0:04:20.060
 had he not dealt with it while losing by
 0:04:18.260,0:04:21.890
 one they need to get level they need to
 0:04:20.060,0:04:25.270
 put the pressure on and got a corner is
 0:04:21.890,0:04:25.270
 a great opportunity for that
 0:04:33.550,0:04:41.639
 messy but the corner well cluttered away
 0:04:36.879,0:04:44.909
 and space for the cross busquets
 0:04:41.639,0:04:44.909
 therapist guess
 0:04:44.910,0:04:51.650
 [Applause]

 0:05:42.480,0:05:44.750
 loins
 0:05:45.439,0:05:52.339

 but all counts were not art or messy
 0:06:43.270,0:06:48.190
 Jordi Alba he's in control of the
 0:06:47.440,0:06:54.220
 situation
 0:06:48.190,0:06:56.430
 Sergio Busquets Frankie Dion Dion r2 has

 Sergio Busquets r2 has it five minutes

 the referee is decided there will be
 0:12:50.680,0:12:58.080
 just one minute of added time and a
 0:12:54.400,0:12:58.080
 substitution in the offing
 0:13:06.310,0:13:11.769
 [Music]

 0:13:24.450,0:13:28.860
 celebrations and quite rightly so
 0:13:26.310,0:13:31.230
 sometimes semi-finals can be a little
 0:13:28.860,0:13:33.930
 bit too much for players one side has to
 0:13:31.230,0:13:35.490
 lose one side goes to the final I'm very
 0:13:33.930,0:13:37.500
 envious of those players look at them
 0:13:35.490,0:13:39.840
 enjoying this moment still work to be
 0:13:37.500,0:13:40.200
 done before they pick that famous trophy

 0:14:14.570,0:14:18.529
 disappointed had he not dealt with it
 0:14:16.250,0:14:21.190
 while losing by one they need to get

 level the Nita
