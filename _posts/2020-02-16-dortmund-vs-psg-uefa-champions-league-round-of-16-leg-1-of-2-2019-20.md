Dortmund vs PSG  
UEFA Champions League | Round of 16 | Leg 1 of 2 | 2019/20  
Stadium : Westfalenstadion 

The only previous encounter between Borussia Dortmund and Paris SG was in the 2010/11 Europa League group stages – both games ended in a draw (1-1 in Dortmund, 0-0 in Paris). 

Borussia Dortmund have always scored at least two goals in their six Champions League home games against French clubs. However, among the 16 teams qualified for this season’s knockout phase, no team scored fewer goals in the group stages (8). 

Borussia Dortmund have made it past the Champions League round of 16 only once in the last five seasons. It was in 2016/17 under current Paris SG manager Thomas Tuchel – they were eventually knocked out by Monaco in the quarter-finals. Borussia Dortmund have lost four of their last six Champions League home games in the knockout phase (W2), including the last two (2-3 v Monaco in 2016/17, 0-1 v Tottenham in 2018/19). 

Borussia Dortmund’s last 22 goals in the Champions League have all come from open play, the longest current run among the remaining sides in the competition.

 0:15:08.340,0:15:10.610
 noise
 0:15:11.060,0:15:15.490
 but it's remaining here
 0:15:13.970,0:15:18.700
 and they can
 0:15:15.490,0:15:21.630
 Akemi they have to be bold borussia
 0:15:18.700,0:15:24.399
 dortmund in these circumstances the
 0:15:21.630,0:15:26.760
 referees verdict is three additional
 0:15:24.399,0:15:26.760
 minutes
 0:15:27.690,0:15:32.300
 that's very smart defending and now they
 0:15:30.000,0:15:35.910
 have the ball again
 0:15:32.300,0:15:38.430
 [Applause]
 0:15:35.910,0:15:39.420

 0:15:38.430,0:15:42.470
 match anyway
 0:15:39.420,0:15:44.850
 PSG with the advantage after 90 minutes
 0:15:42.470,0:15:46.740
 well to be honest via Derick after the
 0:15:44.850,0:15:48.810
 first leg in a semi finai take any
 0:15:46.740,0:15:51.180
 advantage it is a small one not
 0:15:48.810,0:15:54.120
 comfortable one but you'd rather go into
 0:15:51.180,0:15:56.460
 the second leg or run down so lot to
 0:15:54.120,0:16:06.389
 play for still very very tight
 0:15:56.460,0:16:06.389
 [Applause]
 0:16:08.890,0:16:17.740
 [Applause]
 0:16:20.890,0:16:27.700

 [Applause]
 0:16:34.520,0:16:46.080
 the Gold's go by Kilian in Bob a less
 0:16:43.010,0:16:49.070
 than convincing defending
 0:16:46.080,0:16:49.070
 short attention
 0:16:49.860,0:16:53.550
 go over this match but the goalkeeper
 0:16:51.540,0:16:54.570
 had his own views on that subject well
 0:16:53.550,0:17:09.030
 they've been looking for a brace to
 0:16:54.570,0:17:11.660
 strike okay so foiling the opposition by
 0:17:09.030,0:17:11.660
 whatever means
 0:17:11.780,0:17:14.350
 Sancho
 0:17:18.980,0:17:26.470
