 0:00:28.109,0:00:31.859
 I really am I love playing in
 0:00:30.000,0:00:34.079
 semi-finals didn't play in the Champions
 0:00:31.859,0:00:36.390
 League semi-final mine will you find out
 0:00:34.079,0:00:38.760
 about yourself in a semifinal can you
 0:00:36.390,0:00:40.620
 control your emotions can you commit to
 0:00:38.760,0:00:41.129
 the game but we're just about to find
 0:00:40.620,0:00:44.430
 out
 0:00:41.129,0:00:47.740
 very very excited
 0:00:44.430,0:00:48.550
 [Music]
 0:00:47.740,0:01:17.010
 [Applause]
 0:00:48.550,0:01:17.900
 [Music]
 0:01:17.010,0:01:20.290
 [Applause]
 0:01:17.900,0:01:22.510
 [Music]
 0:01:20.290,0:01:25.750
 involving barcel√≥ another one that comes
 0:01:22.510,0:01:27.850
 to mind from Ely 2009 against Chelsea
 0:01:25.750,0:01:29.590
 what an epic that was sky was an FPU can
 0:01:27.850,0:01:31.450
 look back at Club semi-finals and
 0:01:29.590,0:01:33.160
 remember him pretty easily but well she
 0:01:31.450,0:01:35.200
 said we Barcelona it have been so many
 0:01:33.160,0:01:36.610
 and Real Madrid as well but I think
 0:01:35.200,0:01:38.200
 they're going to go all the way this
 0:01:36.610,0:01:39.970
 year I think they'll be in the final and
 0:01:38.200,0:01:44.080
 they could well lift that trophy once
 0:01:39.970,0:01:46.570
 again here's the scene for Napoli Cali
 0:01:44.080,0:01:49.420
 do Coulibaly plays alongside Kostas
 0:01:46.570,0:01:50.979
 Manolos in central defence Allen starts
 0:01:49.420,0:01:53.710
 with Fabian in the centre of midfield
 0:01:50.979,0:01:57.900
 and up Francis a man robbed a genuine
 0:01:53.710,0:01:57.900
 nose for go arcadia shmulik
 0:01:58.610,0:02:08.810
 [Applause]
 0:02:06.200,0:02:11.989
 and the Barcelona shape looks like this
 0:02:08.810,0:02:14.660
 mark and Reiter Stegen starts in go pee
 0:02:11.989,0:02:16.280
 K starts alongside Claymore long clay in
 0:02:14.660,0:02:17.840
 the center of the fence and the
 0:02:16.280,0:02:20.090
 defenders had better be on the toes
 0:02:17.840,0:02:25.970
 because leading the line is luis suarez
 0:02:20.090,0:02:27.770
 and underway now in this Champions
 0:02:25.970,0:02:37.480
 League semi-final first leg
 0:02:27.770,0:02:42.730
 [Applause]
 0:02:37.480,0:02:42.730
 Fabian and here's Alan
 0:02:42.930,0:02:45.690
 and they trouble the opposition this
 0:02:44.670,0:02:48.760
 time
 0:02:45.690,0:02:52.110
 really a very poor bowl
 0:02:48.760,0:02:54.630
 [Applause]
 0:02:52.110,0:02:58.710
 messy
 0:02:54.630,0:03:01.260
 Leonel Messi a stylish ball what can
 0:02:58.710,0:03:03.060
 they do now great challenge he got
 0:03:01.260,0:03:07.599
 nothing but ball
 0:03:03.060,0:03:11.080
 [Applause]
 0:03:07.599,0:03:14.680
 just wanted to get it out of there
 0:03:11.080,0:03:14.680
 here's in senior
 0:03:16.780,0:03:22.019
 [Applause]
 0:03:19.310,0:03:24.000
 well the possession is the name of the
 0:03:22.019,0:03:25.680
 game in terms of the visitors we know
 0:03:24.000,0:03:27.900
 that that's going to be their approach
 0:03:25.680,0:03:29.310
 but how do you deny them well you've got
 0:03:27.900,0:03:31.290
 to keep the ball off them if they get
 0:03:29.310,0:03:33.959
 the ball is very frustrating at times
 0:03:31.290,0:03:37.709
 you can't seem to get a touch on it
 0:03:33.959,0:03:38.659
 is proper football for me though Mario
 0:03:37.709,0:03:41.900
 Rui
 0:03:38.659,0:03:45.059
 it's neat passing confidence on the ball
 0:03:41.900,0:03:45.059
 [Applause]
 0:03:45.270,0:03:51.220
 significant blot from PK
 0:03:48.260,0:03:51.220
 throwings given
 0:03:53.910,0:03:57.700
 [Applause]
 0:03:55.220,0:04:07.330
 [Music]
 0:03:57.700,0:04:07.330
 [Applause]
 0:04:13.680,0:04:21.810
 the cross is on
 0:04:15.560,0:04:24.750
 [Applause]
 0:04:21.810,0:04:26.550
 fantastic and it is the opening goal of
 0:04:24.750,0:04:28.120
 a context where I was always going to be
 0:04:26.550,0:04:30.040
 a tight game but now older
 0:04:28.120,0:04:33.090
 one seemed ahead things have got to
 0:04:30.040,0:04:33.090
 change on both sides
 0:04:41.410,0:04:45.220
 well I want to see this one again and
 0:04:43.060,0:04:47.230
 there it is I wonder how he gets so much
 0:04:45.220,0:04:48.890
 power from that position but he really
 0:04:47.230,0:04:51.889
 does it's a brilliant brilliant
 0:04:48.890,0:04:55.120
 [Music]
 0:04:51.889,0:04:55.120
 to revisit the goal
 0:05:02.310,0:05:06.430
 but I think the coats can feel the game
 0:05:04.750,0:05:09.810
 slipping away here he's showing his
 0:05:06.430,0:05:09.810
 frustration on the sidelines
 0:05:12.690,0:05:19.150
 [Applause]
 0:05:16.150,0:05:22.560
 and the game has been restarted the
 0:05:19.150,0:05:22.560
 advantage belongs to Napoli
 0:05:23.220,0:05:27.279
 [Applause]
 0:05:28.490,0:05:33.650
 I always think it's impossible li not to
 0:05:31.280,0:05:36.050
 be moved when you're covering Barcelona
 0:05:33.650,0:05:38.960
 in the UEFA Champions League as the club
 0:05:36.050,0:05:41.300
 motto tells you mesh Kate one club more
 0:05:38.960,0:05:42.470
 than just a football club well you feel
 0:05:41.300,0:05:44.060
 that as soon as you come into the
 0:05:42.470,0:05:45.800
 stadium don't you even if the team's not
 0:05:44.060,0:05:47.509
 playing particularly well the fans let
 0:05:45.800,0:05:50.389
 you know that they're here to support
 0:05:47.509,0:05:53.349
 those famous Barcelona shirts and they
 0:05:50.389,0:05:55.260
 do it week in week out on tour has it
 0:05:53.349,0:05:57.690
 Sergio Busquets
 0:05:55.260,0:06:01.190
 [Applause]
 0:05:57.690,0:06:01.190
 now push gas
 0:06:01.910,0:06:07.810
 yes ma'am
 0:06:05.110,0:06:10.690
 showing patience as well as persistence
 0:06:07.810,0:06:14.170
 in the Builder gliding through the gears
 0:06:10.690,0:06:15.000
 this might pay dividends a deft
 0:06:14.170,0:06:22.250
 clearance
 0:06:15.000,0:06:22.250
 [Applause]
 0:06:29.480,0:06:35.000
 [Applause]
 0:06:32.150,0:06:37.700
 blade into the center of the box well
 0:06:35.000,0:06:39.740
 that's the end of that for now
 0:06:37.700,0:06:43.720
 [Applause]
 0:06:39.740,0:06:43.720
 and the defender takes care of business
 0:06:44.240,0:06:48.819
 just not looking confident in possession
 0:06:52.620,0:06:58.900
 [Applause]
 0:06:54.380,0:06:58.900
 Mario Rui Fabian
 0:07:01.580,0:07:05.529
 Lorenzo encinia
 0:07:03.360,0:07:07.240
 [Applause]
 0:07:05.529,0:07:11.950
 now he must favor the cross
 0:07:07.240,0:07:15.460
 [Applause]
 0:07:11.950,0:07:17.680
 they referee well here's something we
 0:07:15.460,0:07:19.870
 don't say terribly often Leonel Messi
 0:07:17.680,0:07:21.640
 has been a long way from his best not
 0:07:19.870,0:07:22.090
 really making his mark in this match
 0:07:21.640,0:07:24.280
 League
 0:07:22.090,0:07:26.200
 yeah well the stats don't lie not enough
 0:07:24.280,0:07:27.940
 has been done by the team and he has to
 0:07:26.200,0:07:29.980
 take some of the blame for that too easy
 0:07:27.940,0:07:31.780
 to mark would suggest to me needs to run
 0:07:29.980,0:07:36.270
 around a little bit more it's not rocky
 0:07:31.780,0:07:36.270
 sighs Derek over it comes
 0:07:36.969,0:07:47.690
 safes go
 0:07:38.930,0:07:50.090
 [Applause]
 0:07:47.690,0:07:53.660
 and now see Olinsky
 0:07:50.090,0:07:56.730
 see Lenski a chance forum on the black
 0:07:53.660,0:07:59.490
 [Applause]
 0:07:56.730,0:08:01.760

 busquets jordi alba the blog runner have
 0:08:13.989,0:08:18.849
 given the ball away we've had the
 0:08:16.719,0:08:21.750
 official word there will be a minimum of
 0:08:18.849,0:08:26.940
 two added minutes
 0:08:21.750,0:08:29.340
 are too messy now the managers without
 0:08:26.940,0:08:32.150
 deliver other half-time team talks we're
 0:08:29.340,0:08:35.250
 at the end of 45 minutes in this game
 0:08:32.150,0:08:37.710
 he's been the standout for his side so
 0:08:35.250,0:08:39.840
 far don't you think late well Derek he
 0:08:37.710,0:08:41.640
 certainly was a good 4 to 5 minutes from
 0:08:39.840,0:08:43.409
 the lad obviously got the goal to give
 0:08:41.640,0:08:46.550
 him the lead but he's looked very very
 0:08:43.409,0:08:46.550
 lively as well

 0:09:09.330,0:09:13.320
 the opening goal of the context well it
 0:09:11.790,0:09:17.600
 was always going to be a tight game but
 0:09:13.320,0:09:17.600
