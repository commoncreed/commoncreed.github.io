[Amazon CodeGuru](https://aws.amazon.com/codeguru/) is a machine learning-powered developer tool that helps identify and troubleshoot code issues in real-time. It uses advanced algorithms to provide intelligent recommendations on how to optimize code performance and reduce runtime inefficiencies. Launched in 2020, it has quickly become a popular tool for developers across the world.

CodeGuru consists of two main components: CodeGuru Reviewer and CodeGuru Profiler.

CodeGuru Reviewer is an automated code review tool that scans your code for potential issues and recommends best practices to improve its quality. It can identify common coding errors, security vulnerabilities, and code smells that may cause performance issues. CodeGuru Reviewer works with a variety of programming languages including Java, Python, and Ruby.

CodeGuru Profiler is a performance profiling tool that analyzes the runtime behavior of your applications and identifies the most CPU-intensive code paths. It helps developers optimize their code to reduce runtime inefficiencies and improve performance. CodeGuru Profiler can be used with Java applications running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, containerized applications running on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and serverless applications running on AWS Lambda.

One of the key benefits of CodeGuru is that it integrates seamlessly with other developer tools and services on the AWS platform, such as AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy. This allows developers to incorporate CodeGuru into their existing development workflows without the need for extensive changes.

Another benefit of CodeGuru is its machine learning capabilities. As developers use CodeGuru, it learns from their coding patterns and identifies common mistakes, making it more accurate and effective over time. It also provides a dashboard that shows detailed information on issues identified, including the severity of the issue, the affected code path, and recommended solutions.

In conclusion, Amazon CodeGuru is an innovative tool that uses machine learning to help developers identify and resolve code issues in real-time. Its two main components, CodeGuru Reviewer and CodeGuru Profiler, work together to improve code quality and performance. With its integration with other AWS developer tools and services, CodeGuru makes it easy for developers to incorporate it into their existing workflows. Overall, Amazon CodeGuru is an invaluable tool for any developer looking to optimize their code and improve application performance.
