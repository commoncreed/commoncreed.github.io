Liverpool vs Atlético Madrid  
UEFA Champions League Round of 16 | Leg 2 of 2 | 2019/20  
Stadium: Anfield 

The head-to-head between Atlético Madrid and Liverpool in Europe is perfectly balanced with one win each and two draws (4 goals each). 

However, Atlético eliminated Liverpool in their only knockout tie, it was in the 2009/10 Europa League semi-finals, a tournament Atlético won, beating Fulham 2-1 in the final. 

Atlético Madrid and Liverpool’s only previous Champions League encounters came in the 2008/09 group stages – both games ended 1-1. Liverpool are winless in their last five away games against Spanish opposition in Europe, losing four (D1). 

Their last victory dates back to the Champions League round of 16 in 2008/09, against Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu (1-0). 

Liverpool have always progressed against Spanish opposition in a two-legged Champions League tie (3/3): 2-2 on away goals v Barcelona (2006/07 round of 16), 5-0 on aggregate v Real Madrid (2008/09 round of 16), 4-3 v Barcelona (2018/19 semi-finals). 

Liverpool’s only previous competitive match at the Wanda Metropolitano was last season’s Champions League final against Tottenham – Jürgen Klopp’s men won 2-0.

 0:15:29.209,0:15:38.670
 will he play it in still level here but
 0:15:34.140,0:15:41.700
 the pressure escalating go to film
 0:15:38.670,0:15:47.070
 Edomite fanciness making sure nothing
 0:15:41.700,0:15:48.780
 untoward happened Mohamed Salah now
 0:15:47.070,0:15:54.490
 that's clear
 0:15:48.780,0:15:56.980
 [Applause]
 0:15:54.490,0:16:00.060
 trivia
 0:15:56.980,0:16:03.620
 we found some Korea
 0:16:00.060,0:16:03.620
 my movements from Murata
 0:16:04.400,0:16:09.320
 I'm a god to give them security and
 0:16:08.240,0:16:11.720
 breathing room
 0:16:09.320,0:16:13.400
 what's a chance they have now of making
 0:16:11.720,0:16:17.569
 it true
 0:16:13.400,0:16:19.919
 [Applause]
 0:16:17.569,0:16:21.540
 well here we can see Derek from this
 0:16:19.919,0:16:23.100
 better angle it's all about the
 0:16:21.540,0:16:25.410
 technique when your volley in a ball
 0:16:23.100,0:16:27.179
 it's all about timing let it get to the
 0:16:25.410,0:16:29.429
 right place for your foot to make the
 0:16:27.179,0:16:36.029
 connection and there you go in the back
 0:16:29.429,0:16:37.829
 of the net well I think the coach can
 0:16:36.029,0:16:41.689
 feel the game slipping away here he's
 0:16:37.829,0:16:41.689
 showing his frustration on the sidelines
 0:16:42.710,0:16:47.849
 [Applause]
 0:16:48.790,0:16:59.330
 one-nil then the first period of extra
 0:16:56.030,0:17:17.449
 time is over 15 minutes left maybe after
 0:16:59.330,0:17:19.280
 that penalty and they get the ball
 0:17:17.449,0:17:23.110
 rolling in the second leg of this
 0:17:19.280,0:17:23.110
 Champions League semi-final
 0:17:26.700,0:17:31.200
 an opportunity with the header but not
 0:17:29.040,0:17:34.200
 troubling the goalkeeper at Olli well I
 0:17:31.200,0:17:38.210
 say one thing technique needed options
 0:17:34.200,0:17:39.930
 around him Alexander Arnold has it
 0:17:38.210,0:17:42.600
 [Applause]
 0:17:39.930,0:17:48.480
 the referee has dished out a yellow card
 0:17:42.600,0:17:50.100
 here well it's not malicious just fine
 0:17:48.480,0:17:53.830
 movements from Bharata
 0:17:50.100,0:17:53.830
 [Applause]
 0:17:55.030,0:17:59.750
 timely goal to give them security and
 0:17:58.640,0:18:02.330
 breathing room
 0:17:59.750,0:18:15.080
 what's a chance they have now of making
 0:18:02.330,0:18:17.750
 it so many now having to play through
 0:18:15.080,0:18:26.810
 the pain barrier underway in the second
 0:18:17.750,0:18:29.590
 period of extra time attending here is
 0:18:26.810,0:18:29.590
 defensive chores
 0:18:30.540,0:18:36.749
 so a throw-in here
 0:18:32.170,0:18:36.749
 [Applause]
 0:18:40.610,0:18:44.049
 and here's levar
 0:18:44.270,0:18:49.270
 ready at the far post more Lassa here
 0:18:47.530,0:18:51.030
 the key for making sure that was pushed
 0:18:49.270,0:18:53.230
 well away from danger
 0:18:51.030,0:18:55.620
 Politico get the free-kick decision
 0:18:53.230,0:18:55.620
 their way
 0:18:58.140,0:19:02.239
 [Applause]
 0:19:06.970,0:19:10.220
 [Applause]
 0:19:24.460,0:19:34.349
 [Applause]
 0:19:38.759,0:19:41.510
 and it's going out of play goal kick
 0:19:40.799,0:19:44.799
 coming up
 0:19:41.510,0:19:44.799
 [Applause]
 0:19:49.370,0:20:02.520
 [Applause]
 0:20:09.120,0:20:12.290
 [Applause]
 0:20:15.940,0:20:22.520
 so all Morris are in possession run it
 0:20:19.930,0:20:25.100
 like never simply an intercepted
 0:20:22.520,0:20:27.179
 Murata
 0:20:25.100,0:20:29.669
 [Applause]
 0:20:27.179,0:20:30.360
 across the byline a goal kick as a
 0:20:29.669,0:20:34.070
 result
 0:20:30.360,0:20:34.070
 [Applause]
 0:20:42.540,0:20:45.839
 [Applause]
 0:20:48.250,0:20:58.589
 [Applause]
 0:21:03.610,0:21:10.050
 it's where soul Thomas saw all
 0:21:11.900,0:21:15.220
 fruitful looking attack
 0:21:18.020,0:21:21.399
 Lamarr
 0:21:19.080,0:21:24.619
 [Applause]
 0:21:21.399,0:21:26.950
 the referees verdict is three additional
 0:21:24.619,0:21:26.950
 minutes
 0:21:27.530,0:21:31.430
 attacking play you rather hope you'll
 0:21:29.720,0:21:32.450
 get the decision in your favor but
 0:21:31.430,0:21:34.550
 offside here
 0:21:32.450,0:21:35.420
 yeah the defense got that spot on and so
 0:21:34.550,0:21:39.479
 did the linesman
 0:21:35.420,0:21:39.479
 [Applause]
 0:21:44.410,0:21:58.979
 [Applause]
 0:22:01.380,0:22:06.210
 a chance maybe from the white position
 0:22:03.690,0:22:09.510
 [Applause]
 0:22:06.210,0:22:12.380
 and space for the cross and he's got the
 0:22:09.510,0:22:15.090
 beating of his opponent
 0:22:12.380,0:22:17.999
 danger aversion for now
 0:22:15.090,0:22:20.820
 that's it official now and clinical
 0:22:17.999,0:22:22.409
 Madrid have reached the final why when
 0:22:20.820,0:22:24.929
 you start your journey at the start of
 0:22:22.409,0:22:26.610
 this competition you look forward to the
 0:22:24.929,0:22:28.110
 final you might not think you're going
 0:22:26.610,0:22:30.509
 to get there but now all of a sudden
 0:22:28.110,0:22:32.639
 it's become a reality extra time winner
 0:22:30.509,0:22:35.630
 that'll do me in to the final with
 0:22:32.639,0:22:43.470
 confidence can they pick the trophy
 0:22:35.630,0:22:43.470
 [Applause]
 0:22:52.930,0:22:56.160
 [Applause]
 0:22:59.800,0:23:03.760
 and they get the ball rolling in the
 0:23:01.930,0:23:06.300
 second leg of this Champions League
 0:23:03.760,0:23:06.300
 semi-final
 0:23:10.440,0:23:14.790
 an opportunity with the header but not
 0:23:12.630,0:23:17.850
 troubling the goalkeeper atole well I
 0:23:14.790,0:23:19.250
 say one thing technique needed options
 0:23:17.850,0:23:23.000
 around him
 0:23:19.250,0:23:23.000
 Alexander Arnold has it
 0:23:23.270,0:23:29.480
 the referee has dished out a yellow card
 0:23:26.220,0:23:29.480
 here well it's not malicious
 0:23:31.460,0:23:35.470
 fine movements from Maratha
 0:23:38.400,0:23:43.350
 I'm a timely goal to give them security
 0:23:41.430,0:23:45.930
 and breathing room
 0:23:43.350,0:23:48.050
 what's a chance they have down of making
 0:23:45.930,0:23:48.050
 it
