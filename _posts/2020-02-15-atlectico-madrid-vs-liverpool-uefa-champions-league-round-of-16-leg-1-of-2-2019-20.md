Atlético Madrid vs Liverpool  
UEFA Champions League Round of 16 | Leg 1 of 2 | 2019/20  
Stadium: Wanda Metropolitano Stadium 

The head-to-head between Atlético Madrid and Liverpool in Europe is perfectly balanced with one win each and two draws (4 goals each). However, Atlético eliminated Liverpool in their only knockout tie, it was in the 2009/10 Europa League semi-finals, a tournament Atlético won, beating Fulham 2-1 in the final.

Atlético Madrid and Liverpool’s only previous Champions League encounters came in the 2008/09 group stages – both games ended 1-1. 

Liverpool are winless in their last five away games against Spanish opposition in Europe, losing four (D1). Their last victory dates back to the Champions League round of 16 in 2008/09, against Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu (1-0). 

Liverpool have always progressed against Spanish opposition in a two-legged Champions League tie (3/3): 2-2 on away goals v Barcelona (2006/07 round of 16), 5-0 on aggregate v Real Madrid (2008/09 round of 16), 4-3 v Barcelona (2018/19 semi-finals).

Liverpool’s only previous competitive match at the Wanda Metropolitano was last season’s Champions League final against Tottenham – Jürgen Klopp’s men won 2-0.
