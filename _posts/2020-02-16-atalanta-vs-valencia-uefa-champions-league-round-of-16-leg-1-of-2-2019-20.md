Atalanta vs Valencia  
UEFA Champions League | Round of 16 | Leg 1 of 2 | 2019/20  
Stadium : San Siro 

This will be the first encounter between Atalanta and Valencia. It’s also the first time the team from Bergamo will face Spanish opposition in a competitive fixture. 

Valencia have won only one of their eight away games against Italian opposition in the Champions League (D2 L5), a 1-0 victory against Roma in the 2002/03 second group stages. 

They have also failed to find the net in six of those eight games. 

Atalanta are the first Champions League debutant to make it to the knockout stages of the Champions League since Leicester City in 2016/17 – the English side were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals by Atlético Madrid. 

Under the current format (since 2003/04), Atalanta are the first team to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League after losing their opening three group games. Atalanta won two of their six games in this season’s Champions League group phase (against Dinamo Zagreb and Shakhtar Donetsk), the lowest tally alongside Lyon among the 16 remaining teams.

 0:03:11.500,0:03:18.440
 Martin Darren all was difficult to
 0:03:16.370,0:03:20.750
 predict in advance who might decide a
 0:03:18.440,0:03:22.940
 game but you could make a strong case
 0:03:20.750,0:03:24.860
 for this man Lee what are you
 0:03:22.940,0:03:26.270
 anticipating seeing from him well when
 0:03:24.860,0:03:27.980
 he playing against a player sometimes
 0:03:26.270,0:03:29.780

 0:03:27.980,0:03:31.970
 qualities I see a good hold up players
 0:03:29.780,0:03:37.370
 and quick as he this is he that when
 0:03:31.970,0:03:43.370

 0:03:49.250,0:03:54.310
 scores let's go back to the goal that
 0:03:51.710,0:03:54.310

 0:04:35.440,0:04:43.449
 [Applause]
 0:04:41.740,0:04:45.130
 now you've got to try to make it a bit
 0:04:43.449,0:04:48.610
 more difficult for your opponent than
 0:04:45.130,0:04:50.849
 that well that's a foul and it sets up a
 0:04:48.610,0:04:53.590
 free-kick in a dangerous position
 0:04:50.849,0:04:54.250
 following that tackle he's got to go
 0:04:53.590,0:04:55.810
 into the book
 0:04:54.250,0:04:58.370
 yeah he's missed time more than anything
 0:04:55.810,0:05:02.860
 they're just missed time these tackle
 0:04:58.370,0:05:02.860
 [Applause]
 0:05:17.420,0:05:25.059

 free-kick perfection Lee yeah it just

 0:05:36.670,0:05:39.060
 as well
 0:05:53.639,0:05:57.919
 giving the ball to the opposition that
 0:05:55.680,0:05:57.919
 time
 0:06:00.140,0:06:05.150
 now he has been ruled offside here can't
 0:06:03.080,0:06:06.800
 Devine by an awful lot who I'm not too
 0:06:05.150,0:06:09.310
 sure but the lines has got better view
 0:06:06.800,0:06:09.310
 than I have
 0:06:20.520,0:06:26.590
 remote trailer
 0:06:23.690,0:06:30.210

 0:06:26.590,0:06:30.210
 kryla in possession
 0:06:31.040,0:06:38.760
 Martin Darren Gomez
 0:06:36.750,0:06:43.640
 setting off perhaps a little bit too
 0:06:38.760,0:06:43.640
 much here a perfectly time pass
 0:06:43.740,0:06:48.890
 he got nothing but ball he's conceded
 0:06:46.440,0:06:48.890
 the corner
 0:06:58.490,0:07:09.670
 [Applause]
 0:07:06.630,0:07:11.910
 and overcomes the corner and punched
 0:07:09.670,0:07:11.910
 away
 0:07:13.969,0:07:17.319
 and the throw in forthcoming
 0:07:22.409,0:07:27.300
 it's with Robin Gerson's options in the
 0:07:25.589,0:07:29.400
 center
 0:07:27.300,0:07:32.120
 just unable to get his cross beyond the
 0:07:29.400,0:07:32.120
 first defender
 0:07:33.990,0:07:37.190
 we've given it away
 0:07:42.050,0:07:45.580
 well they have the ball once more
 0:07:46.400,0:07:51.430
 poor touch and they no longer have
 0:07:48.500,0:07:51.430
 custody of the ball
 0:07:54.200,0:08:04.650
 [Applause]
 0:08:00.660,0:08:06.570
 it's with Tyrone Dawson's for the quite
 0:08:04.650,0:08:12.050
 content to knock it around inside their
 0:08:06.570,0:08:12.050
 own half well he's given us away
 0:08:14.100,0:08:17.630
 options around him
 0:08:18.199,0:08:21.129
 Lorenzi
 0:08:21.290,0:08:24.100
 good tackle
 0:08:25.840,0:08:29.520
 cleared away comprehensively
 0:08:36.140,0:08:40.159
 for NZ on the ball
 0:08:38.240,0:08:46.369
 and it's played into the center a
 0:08:40.159,0:08:48.589
 decisive clearance it was Zapata the
 0:08:46.369,0:08:50.079
 referees verdict is three additional
 0:08:48.589,0:08:53.079
 minutes
 0:08:50.079,0:08:53.079
 baccala
 0:08:55.760,0:09:04.180
 the chance of ever leaves to square the

 0:09:13.329,0:09:22.029
 learned that one at school Derek poor
 0:09:15.160,0:09:24.209
 defended here a chance to revisit the
 0:09:22.029,0:09:24.209
 goal
 0:09:28.750,0:09:33.220
 [Applause]
 0:09:45.470,0:09:50.350
 well the earlier girl cancelled out one
 0:09:48.050,0:09:50.350
 apiece
 0:09:52.220,0:09:56.890
 and with that the first half draws to a
 0:09:54.800,0:09:56.890
 close
 0:09:59.190,0:10:04.170
 he's been the standout for his side so
 0:10:01.889,0:10:06.089
 far don't you think Lee well it's never
 0:10:04.170,0:10:08.339
 a bad time to score a goal but just
 0:10:06.089,0:10:10.949
 before half-time could be crucial and
 0:10:08.339,0:10:14.329
 he's got his team back in this game what
 0:10:10.949,0:10:14.329
 can he produce in the second half
 0:10:20.810,0:10:27.070
 and underway now in this Champions

 0:10:37.940,0:10:45.320
 they're celebrating you've got to try to
 0:10:43.760,0:10:48.190
 make it a bit more difficult for your
 0:10:45.320,0:10:48.190
 opponent than that
 0:10:49.679,0:10:54.839
 following that tackle he's got to go
 0:10:52.360,0:10:54.839
 into the book
 0:10:59.050,0:11:01.830
 Vallejo
 0:11:02.920,0:11:06.069
 well that was close to free-kick
 0:11:05.019,0:11:07.779
 perfection Lee
 0:11:06.069,0:11:10.290
 yeah just didn't quite get enough dip
 0:11:07.779,0:11:10.290
 only to do
 0:11:16.310,0:11:21.660
 some other Lakes
 0:11:19.020,0:11:25.610
 and they done it to square the game once
 0:11:21.660,0:11:25.610
 again accelerating
 0:11:27.270,0:11:30.490
 [Music]
 0:11:39.480,0:11:46.260
 second half of this Champions League
 0:11:42.030,0:11:47.930
 semi-final first leg underway and on the
 0:11:46.260,0:11:53.270
 ball gaya
 0:11:47.930,0:11:53.270
 Maximiliano Gomes far from a good pass
 0:11:55.400,0:11:58.870
 and it's a quality pass
 0:12:03.570,0:12:10.140
 hey Mort fry now it needs an accurate
 0:12:06.390,0:12:19.730
 cross the attack promising as it was
 0:12:10.140,0:12:19.730
 scupper there it's with per a ho
 0:12:19.769,0:12:22.980
 and you've got to try to make it a bit
 0:12:21.300,0:12:25.160
 more difficult for your opponent than
 0:12:22.980,0:12:25.160
 that
 0:12:32.060,0:12:38.080
 it's with Tyrone a stylish ball what can
 0:12:35.660,0:12:38.080
 they do now
 0:12:40.500,0:12:44.580
 this looks promising with the game level
 0:12:43.050,0:12:46.350
 let's see what they can do with this
 0:12:44.580,0:12:48.960
 corner
 0:12:46.350,0:12:51.440
 they decided but now is the time to go
 0:12:48.960,0:12:51.440
 to the bench
 0:12:52.330,0:12:59.230
 [Applause]
 0:13:00.940,0:13:07.430
 corner kick played over really wanted to
 0:13:04.430,0:13:12.740
 get it past the first defender then he
 0:13:07.430,0:13:16.410
 has time to play us over Gomes in
 0:13:12.740,0:13:18.269
 position here to protect the ball
 0:13:16.410,0:13:20.579
 one thing he does know how to do he's
 0:13:18.269,0:13:25.709
 shield the ball an attack full of
 0:13:20.579,0:13:28.199
 promise passing it around well
 0:13:25.709,0:13:30.029
 first-rate girl keep it off he can't
 0:13:28.199,0:13:32.690
 believe the goalkeeper save that ass
 0:13:30.029,0:13:32.690
 brilliant
 0:13:44.209,0:13:50.449
 now the delivery poor corner way
 0:13:47.779,0:13:55.119
 overheat explain is out over the touch
 0:13:50.449,0:13:55.119
 line so I throw in to restore things
 0:14:01.630,0:14:08.110
 castaigne certainly allowing their
 0:14:04.790,0:14:08.110
 opponents to come on to them
 0:14:12.370,0:14:18.000
 jose-luis Palomino excellent passing
 0:14:19.220,0:14:24.170
 hunting of players waiting in the middle
 0:14:21.399,0:14:26.839
 it did appear that they might be onto
 0:14:24.170,0:14:31.610
 something but not so well the counter
 0:14:26.839,0:14:38.329
 chance looks very real when Sardo get
 0:14:31.610,0:14:42.050
 I'm Rodrigo has it not NZ given away
 0:14:38.329,0:14:44.470
 who's on a garnish it's a perfect
 0:14:42.050,0:14:44.470
 challenge
 0:14:47.460,0:14:58.880
 malinovski Raphael tolai team emerging
 0:14:56.110,0:15:01.760
 of wastes of possession
 0:14:58.880,0:15:03.670
 [Applause]
 0:15:01.760,0:15:06.180
 gomez
 0:15:03.670,0:15:08.620
 might be able to set up the chance
 0:15:06.180,0:15:10.330
 absolutely magnificent Gogebic
 0:15:08.620,0:15:14.350
 oh he's almost turning away he thinks he
 0:15:10.330,0:15:15.970
 scored the goalkeeper doesn't there has
 0:15:14.350,0:15:18.700
 been plenty of limbering up from
 0:15:15.970,0:15:21.000
 substitutes and now both sides will make
 0:15:18.700,0:15:26.639
 personnel switches
 0:15:21.000,0:15:26.639
 [Applause]

 0:15:40.990,0:15:44.200
 danger averted
 0:15:46.140,0:15:51.650

 0:15:48.650,0:15:55.320
 only ten minutes remaining here
 0:15:51.650,0:15:57.330
 that's a lovely ball well the home fans

 a little bit frustrated today the team
