Utilizing the power of this platform needs some getting used to. Just to make the process even easy for our readers, we have curated a perfect list of programming questions to start with.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR&lt;/code&gt; is a four-digit number, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MONTH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DAY&lt;/code&gt; are both two-digit numbers, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MARKUP&lt;/code&gt; is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

 German footballers and say they're very
 0:01:52.010,0:01:55.670
 machine-like when they play but whenever
 0:01:54.050,0:01:57.800
 I played against Bayern Munich it was
 0:01:55.670,0:02:00.200
 always a case of looking at the team and
 0:01:57.800,0:02:02.210
 finding no weaknesses there's no areas
 0:02:00.200,0:02:04.990
 of the team where you can exploit and I
 0:02:02.210,0:02:08.270
 think that's their biggest strength
 0:02:04.990,0:02:10.880
 here's the lineup for Chelsea Kephart
 0:02:08.270,0:02:13.130
 is given the green light in goal andreas
 0:02:10.880,0:02:15.260
 Kristensen plays with Antonio r√ºdiger
 0:02:13.130,0:02:17.989
 and central defence and Gotha Conte
 0:02:15.260,0:02:20.360
 stands alongside Giorgio in the centre
 0:02:17.989,0:02:22.459
 of midfield and the idea is to have just
 0:02:20.360,0:02:25.810
 the one striker up there trying to pose
 0:02:22.459,0:02:25.810
 problems for the opposition
 0:02:31.990,0:02:34.920
 here's Thiago
 0:02:35.710,0:02:40.850
 while many have remarked upon the hosts
 0:02:38.870,0:02:42.830
 and the preferred style which is one of
 0:02:40.850,0:02:44.900
 high pressing and trying to get the ball
 0:02:42.830,0:02:47.000
 back quickly Lee do you expect to see
 0:02:44.900,0:02:48.590
 more of that in this game yes deric high
 0:02:47.000,0:02:50.450
 pressing is their game but there is a
 0:02:48.590,0:02:52.760
 risk attached to it if the opposition
 0:02:50.450,0:02:57.910
 break through that press early on you
 0:02:52.760,0:02:57.910
 can be left vulnerable at the back Munna
 0:03:01.950,0:03:05.030
 fixing opportunity
 0:03:05.590,0:03:12.090
 Munna and Pavan on the
 0:03:08.710,0:03:12.090
 don't ski in the thick of things
 0:03:15.349,0:03:18.370
 go ahead Scott
 0:03:21.420,0:03:28.550
 passing it around with a flaw
 0:03:24.920,0:03:30.410
 it's a goal kick are the mere mention of
 0:03:28.550,0:03:32.569
 the name of Albert levin dosti can have
 0:03:30.410,0:03:34.640
 the effect of striking fear in opposing
 0:03:32.569,0:03:36.470
 defenses Lee what do you expect to see
 0:03:34.640,0:03:38.360
 from him today he's on the ball all the
 0:03:36.470,0:03:40.700
 time and his ability on the ball is
 0:03:38.360,0:03:42.290
 absolutely phenomenal he doesn't pass
 0:03:40.700,0:03:44.360
 the ball away he lends it to his
 0:03:42.290,0:03:48.910
 teammates because he wants it back very
 0:03:44.360,0:03:51.080
 difficult to get the ball off him Thiago
 0:03:48.910,0:03:54.160
 that's enough people
 0:03:51.080,0:03:57.060
 Serg can happily
 0:03:54.160,0:03:57.060
 that's a no toy
 0:04:01.530,0:04:06.440
 here's coverage beautifully disguise
 0:04:04.200,0:04:09.050
 ball
 0:04:06.440,0:04:11.440
 typical of William to be wasteful as he

 0:04:22.800,0:04:25.310

 0:04:28.189,0:04:31.310
 it was always going to be in a tight
 0:04:29.449,0:04:33.319
 game but now all of a sudden one team
 0:04:31.310,0:04:37.129

 0:04:33.319,0:04:38.660

 0:04:37.129,0:04:42.289
 first time you
 0:04:38.660,0:04:44.089
 very difficult to strike a ball
 0:04:42.289,0:04:45.649
 technique has to be right but above all
 0:04:44.089,0:04:47.300
 you have to concentrate on the borns
 0:04:45.649,0:04:48.580
 it's coming to you you know you're not
 0:04:47.300,0:04:51.840
 going to take a clutch
 0:04:48.580,0:04:51.840
 concentration is everything

 0:00:15.150,0:00:20.070
 Arsenal and England fullback Lee Dixon
 0:00:17.220,0:00:22.380
 and Barcelona know full well they have a
 0:00:20.070,0:00:24.510
 lot of work to do in the second and
 0:00:22.380,0:00:27.599
 decisive leg of this Champions League
 0:00:24.510,0:00:29.760
 semi-final its Barcelona up against
 0:00:27.599,0:00:32.189
 Napoli while the visitors played really
 0:00:29.760,0:00:34.410
 well in the home leg gaining that small
 0:00:32.189,0:00:36.090
 lead well this is a different story away
 0:00:34.410,0:00:37.980
 from their ground away from their fans
 0:00:36.090,0:00:41.520
 who knows how they're going to react
 0:00:37.980,0:00:44.360
 really excited about this one Derek
 0:00:41.520,0:00:47.460
 [Applause]

 0:01:41.100,0:01:46.320
 [Applause]
 0:01:43.290,0:01:49.530
 looks like this mark and racist against
 0:01:46.320,0:01:51.840
 Dotson go pee K starts alongside Clemen
 0:01:49.530,0:01:53.520
 log lay in the center of defense and the
 0:01:51.840,0:01:55.810
 defenders have better be on the terms
 0:01:53.520,0:02:00.249
 because leading the line is Luis Suarez
 0:01:55.810,0:02:00.249
 [Applause]
 0:02:02.040,0:02:05.159
 [Music]
 0:02:06.040,0:02:11.110
 a glance at the Napoli side well there's
 0:02:09.130,0:02:13.180
 no great mystery is there we know
 0:02:11.110,0:02:15.610
 normally how they're going to play and
 0:02:13.180,0:02:18.280
 it's all about applying as much pressure
 0:02:15.610,0:02:19.870
 as possible Lee can we anticipate seeing
 0:02:18.280,0:02:21.970
 more of the same today yeah absolutely
 0:02:19.870,0:02:23.710
 Derek if you're really good at something
 0:02:21.970,0:02:25.900
 then why not they're very good at this
 0:02:23.710,0:02:28.630
 all the team members have bought into
 0:02:25.900,0:02:30.650
 this style of play one player slacks off
 0:02:28.630,0:02:33.160
 and it all falls apart
 0:02:30.650,0:02:36.060
 [Applause]
 0:02:33.160,0:02:36.060
 and away by Barcelona

 [Applause]
 0:03:32.380,0:03:35.590

 the keeper would have been disappointed

 0:04:21.890,0:04:25.270
 a great opportunity for that
 0:04:33.550,0:04:41.639
 messy but the corner well cluttered away
 0:04:36.879,0:04:44.909

 0:13:28.860,0:13:33.930
 bit too much for players one side has to
 0:13:31.230,0:13:35.490

 0:00:05.990,0:00:12.389
 and the warm welcome on what is an ideal
 0:00:09.660,0:00:14.340
 night for football you've got to say my
 0:00:12.389,0:00:16.800
 name is Derrick ray and I'm joined for
 0:00:14.340,0:00:19.199
 commentary by Lee Dixon and what we have
 0:00:16.800,0:00:22.109
 to look forward to is the second leg of
 0:00:19.199,0:00:24.600
 this Champions League semi-final bleep
 0:00:22.109,0:00:26.490
 this ought to be special well direct my
 0:00:24.600,0:00:28.920
 suggestion is you play the game as if
 0:00:26.490,0:00:31.679
 it's all square if you start to protect
 0:00:28.920,0:00:33.870
 a small margin too much this game can
 0:00:31.679,0:00:36.410
 run away from you I'm really looking
 0:00:33.870,0:00:36.410
 forward to this
 0:00:37.250,0:00:44.750
 [Music]

 [Applause]
 0:00:48.720,0:01:41.839
 [Music]
 0:01:19.490,0:01:41.839
 [Applause]
 0:01:41.939,0:01:47.549
 the line up there in the fort of the
 0:01:43.590,0:01:50.100
 hosts and they are a team Lee known for
 0:01:47.549,0:01:52.310
 the aggressive high pressing absolutely
 0:01:50.100,0:01:55.079
 that takes a lot of hard work a lot of
 0:01:52.310,0:01:57.209
 organization force your position to make
 0:01:55.079,0:01:59.700
 early passes the weakness of it if you
 0:01:57.209,0:02:02.270
 beat the high press you can get exposed
 0:01:59.700,0:02:02.270
 in the back
 0:02:06.460,0:02:11.860
 for Olympic Leon air it looks like this
 0:02:08.530,0:02:14.200
 Anthony Lopez begins in goal Marcel
 0:02:11.860,0:02:17.140
 starts with Kenny get it in the fallback
 0:02:14.200,0:02:19.660
 positions Luca to sob plays with who SEM
 0:02:17.140,0:02:22.030
 Awad in central midfield and they line
 0:02:19.660,0:02:24.630
 up with just the one striker looking to
 0:02:22.030,0:02:24.630
 do a bit of damage
 0:02:30.760,0:02:33.599
 Khedira
 0:02:34.130,0:02:38.960
 it's with Gonzalo higua√≠n
 0:02:36.830,0:02:41.470
 in a position from which they could
 0:02:38.960,0:02:44.410
 potentially do a bit of damage here
 0:02:41.470,0:02:49.930
 delete
 0:02:44.410,0:02:52.739
 now Matt Sweeney peonage Matt sweetie
 0:02:49.930,0:02:52.739
 Jannik
 0:02:52.790,0:02:58.069
 it is the perfect stage for a top player
 0:02:55.370,0:03:01.189
 and this man takes every game very
 0:02:58.069,0:03:05.120
 seriously he's out forgot versus blended
 0:03:01.189,0:03:07.740
 ball from Ronaldo Macau it is and what a
 0:03:05.120,0:03:10.180
 significant one
 0:03:07.740,0:03:12.350
 [Applause]
 0:03:10.180,0:03:15.950
 an extra time
 0:03:12.350,0:03:17.870
 possibility while the keeper have been
 0:03:15.950,0:03:19.550
 frustrated he thought he'd saved it was
 0:03:17.870,0:03:19.840
 so unlucky there is a good angle from
 0:03:19.550,0:03:23.200
 him
 0:03:19.840,0:03:26.849
 well what is in the packet in it
 0:03:23.200,0:03:26.849
 a chance to revisit the goal
 0:03:31.210,0:03:36.409
 [Applause]
 0:03:44.660,0:03:49.690
 so 1 1 it is on aggregate

 [Applause]
 0:03:56.569,0:04:00.700

 0:04:44.330,0:04:48.910
 Matsui D losing possession here
 0:04:51.510,0:04:59.690

 0:04:59.969,0:05:05.749
 and teammates to play it too
 0:05:02.479,0:05:07.939
 that's clear well Derek is so finely
 0:05:05.749,0:05:09.930
 balanced you just wonder if set pieces
 0:05:07.939,0:05:23.569
 will be the difference today
 0:05:09.930,0:05:26.240
 [Applause]
 0:05:23.569,0:05:29.029
 and overcomes the corner high-class

 0:05:49.990,0:05:55.970

 0:05:57.580,0:06:10.480
 [Applause]
 0:06:27.500,0:06:30.700
 it's worth to saw

 0:06:34.570,0:06:39.360
 [Applause]

 0:06:45.700,0:06:51.330
 teni a is with Allah
 0:06:49.860,0:06:54.020
 and you've got to keep the ball a bit
 0:06:51.330,0:06:54.020
 better than that
 0:06:57.340,0:07:04.420
 it continues to make hay and the cross
 0:07:00.040,0:07:08.840
 is very much on Alexandra waiting at the
 0:07:04.420,0:07:12.120
 farmers Gonzalo higua√≠n anti-god
 0:07:08.840,0:07:12.900
 accuracy with the header just what they
 0:07:12.120,0:07:21.930
 need
 0:07:12.900,0:07:24.690
 [Applause]
 0:07:21.930,0:07:27.090
 we put some super balls in from the wide
 0:07:24.690,0:07:31.520
 areas and that one's probably the best
 0:07:27.090,0:07:33.740
 and what did they get reward a goal
 0:07:31.520,0:07:36.160
 the goal again albeit from a different
 0:07:33.740,0:07:36.160
 angle
 0:07:55.409,0:07:59.689
 one is the aggregate lead 
 0:08:08.470,0:08:13.260
 wonderful challenge the throw-in coming
 0:08:11.140,0:08:13.260

 [Applause]

 [Applause]
 0:08:21.870,0:08:26.870
 is with our others to play it too
 0:08:29.320,0:08:35.169
 Matuidi racing forward trying to catch
 0:08:32.380,0:08:38.620
 them out on that break looked so
 0:08:35.169,0:08:40.780
 promising but nothing coming from it -
 0:08:38.620,0:08:43.100
 sorry
 0:08:40.780,0:08:45.440
 we've been waiting to find out now we
 0:08:43.100,0:08:47.650
 know a minimum of three added minutes
 0:08:45.440,0:08:47.650
 here
 0:08:49.560,0:08:54.870
 teammate in support that was fired
 0:08:52.290,0:08:56.760
 straight up Nikita no real difficulties
 0:08:54.870,0:08:58.680
 for him no decent position from the
 0:08:56.760,0:09:01.860
 goalkeeper poor shot to be honest beer
 0:08:58.680,0:09:02.370
 and so it is the first half story has
 0:09:01.860,0:09:09.970
 been rated
 0:09:02.370,0:09:09.970
 [Applause]
 0:09:25.450,0:09:32.470
 [Music]
 0:09:36.460,0:09:41.370

 0:09:39.380,0:09:44.820
 [Applause]
 0:09:41.370,0:09:47.190

 0:14:11.020,0:14:15.550
 look at the celebrations and quite
 0:14:12.580,0:14:17.410
 rightly so sometimes semi-finals can be
 0:14:15.550,0:14:19.690
 a little bit too much for players one
 0:14:17.410,0:14:21.970
 side has to lose one side goes to the
 0:14:19.690,0:14:23.980
 final I'm very envious of those players
 0:14:21.970,0:14:25.810
 look at them enjoying this moment still
 0:14:23.980,0:14:29.100
 work to be done before they peak that

 [Applause]

 0:14:52.150,0:14:57.040
 second leg of this Champions League
 0:14:53.980,0:14:59.280
 semi-final opportunity to deliver the
 0:14:57.040,0:14:59.280

 0:15:01.320,0:15:05.700
 it just over the bar yeah he thinks he's
 0:15:03.960,0:15:12.650
 in he thinks he's scored and he's just
 0:15:05.700,0:15:12.650
 over the bar he continues to make hay
 0:15:13.410,0:15:16.249
 mantra
 0:15:17.240,0:15:22.040
 and that time they go to give them
 0:15:19.850,0:15:24.619
 security and breathing room
 0:15:22.040,0:15:26.740

&lt;p&gt;Liverpool vs Atl√©tico Madrid&lt;br /&gt;
UEFA Champions League Round of 16 | Leg 2 of 2 | 2019/20&lt;br /&gt;
Stadium: Anfield&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head-to-head between Atl√©tico Madrid and Liverpool in Europe is perfectly balanced with one win each and two draws (4 goals each).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Atl√©tico eliminated Liverpool in their only knockout tie, it was in the 2009/10 Europa League semi-finals, a tournament Atl√©tico won, beating Fulham 2-1 in the final.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atl√©tico Madrid and Liverpool‚Äôs only previous Champions League encounters came in the 2008/09 group stages ‚Äì both games ended 1-1. Liverpool are winless in their last five away games against Spanish opposition in Europe, losing four (D1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their last victory dates back to the Champions League round of 16 in 2008/09, against Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu (1-0).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liverpool have always progressed against Spanish opposition in a two-legged Champions League tie (3/3): 2-2 on away goals v Barcelona (2006/07 round of 16), 5-0 on aggregate v Real Madrid (2008/09 round of 16), 4-3 v Barcelona (2018/19 semi-finals).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liverpool‚Äôs only previous competitive match at the Wanda Metropolitano was last season‚Äôs Champions League final against Tottenham ‚Äì J√ºrgen Klopp‚Äôs men won 2-0.&lt;/p&gt;

 technique when your volley in a ball
 0:16:23.100,0:16:27.179
 it's all about timing let it get to the
 0:16:25.410,0:16:29.429
 right place for your foot to make the
 0:16:27.179,0:16:36.029
 connection and there you go in the back
 0:16:29.429,0:16:37.829

 timely goal to give them security and
 0:17:58.640,0:18:02.330

UEFA Champions League | Round of 16 | Leg 2 of 2 | 2019/20&lt;br /&gt;
Stadium : Parc des Princes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only previous encounter between Borussia Dortmund and Paris SG was in the 2010/11 Europa League group stages ‚Äì both games ended in a draw (1-1 in Dortmund, 0-0 in Paris).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borussia Dortmund have always scored at least two goals in their six Champions League home games against French clubs. However, among the 16 teams qualified for this season‚Äôs knockout phase, no team scored fewer goals in the group stages (8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borussia Dortmund have made it past the Champions League round of 16 only once in the last five seasons. It was in 2016/17 under current Paris SG manager Thomas Tuchel ‚Äì they were eventually knocked out by Monaco in the quarter-finals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borussia Dortmund have lost four of their last six Champions League home games in the knockout phase (W2), including the last two (2-3 v Monaco in 2016/17, 0-1 v Tottenham in 2018/19).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borussia Dortmund‚Äôs last 22 goals in the Champions League have all come from open play, the longest current run among the remaining sides in the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

 the girl but I'm not sure he was ever
 0:14:10.770,0:14:15.090
 good to score with that bicycle kick
 0:14:12.480,0:14:17.930
 well overhead kick looks good not really
 0:14:15.090,0:14:17.930
 the option though
 0:14:29.740,0:14:36.790
 here's marquinhos the referee's vessel
 0:14:34.300,0:14:39.550

 0:14:39.550,0:14:44.080
 look at the celebrations and quite
 0:14:41.140,0:14:45.940
 rightly so sometimes semi-finals can be
 0:14:44.080,0:14:48.220
 a little bit too much for players one
 0:14:45.940,0:14:50.500
 side has to lose one side goes to the
 0:14:48.220,0:14:52.510
 final I'm very envious of those players
 0:14:50.500,0:14:54.370
 look at them enjoying this moment still
 0:14:52.510,0:14:55.900
 work to be done before they beat that

 key back well that's what you pay him
 0:15:47.810,0:15:52.840
 for defenders defend goalkeepers make
 0:15:50.270,0:15:52.840
 saves like

 photographers behind the girl but I'm
 0:16:01.360,0:16:07.050

&lt;p&gt;Valencia vs Atalanta&lt;br /&gt;
UEFA Champions League | Round of 16 | Leg 2 of 2 | 2019/20&lt;br /&gt;
Stadium : Mestalla&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be the first encounter between Atalanta and Valencia. It‚Äôs also the first time the team from Bergamo will face Spanish opposition in a competitive fixture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valencia have won only one of their eight away games against Italian opposition in the Champions League (D2 L5), a 1-0 victory against Roma in the 2002/03 second group stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have also failed to find the net in six of those eight games. Atalanta are the first Champions League debutant to make it to the knockout stages of the Champions League since Leicester City in 2016/17 ‚Äì the English side were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals by Atl√©tico Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the current format (since 2003/04), Atalanta are the first team to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League after losing their opening three group games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atalanta won two of their six games in this season‚Äôs Champions League group phase (against Dinamo Zagreb and Shakhtar Donetsk), the lowest tally alongside Lyon among the 16 remaining teams.&lt;/p&gt;

 0:00:31.830,0:00:36.329
 cracker of a game got the advantage from
 0:00:34.170,0:00:38.579
 that first leg what do the home side do
 0:00:36.329,0:00:40.079
 what the away side to for they attack
 0:00:38.579,0:00:41.810
 from the start they need to put the
 0:00:40.079,0:00:42.880
 pressure on
 0:00:41.810,0:00:47.970

 Danny pareja starts with Francis Coppola
 0:01:29.160,0:01:33.660
 in the centre of midfield and so many
 0:01:31.530,0:01:37.730
 different ways to configure an attack in
 0:01:33.660,0:01:37.730
 this case it'll be to man up front
 0:01:50.480,0:01:55.189
 [Applause]
 0:02:03.510,0:02:08.610
 we're starting a lemon for Atalanta
 0:02:06.020,0:02:10.200
 wing-backs are important on this set up
 0:02:08.610,0:02:12.000
 that you enjoy your experience of
 0:02:10.200,0:02:14.040
 playing at Wing Batley not at all in the
 0:02:12.000,0:02:16.110
 Bruce Rock answer very very demanding
 0:02:14.040,0:02:18.380
 role as we can see the full-backs are
 0:02:16.110,0:02:21.240
 exposed both offensively and defensively
 0:02:18.380,0:02:22.800
 lots of support inside them but going
 0:02:21.240,0:02:26.330
 forward they need to try and get the
 0:02:22.800,0:02:26.330

&lt;p&gt;RB Leipzig have reached the Champions League knockout stages for the first time in their history. Wolfsburg are the last German team ‚Äì outside of Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund ‚Äì to make it past the round of 16, back in 2015/16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tottenham conceded 14 goals in this season‚Äôs Champions League group phase, the highest tally among the remaining teams in the competition. Half of those goals came in their home game against Bayern Munich (2-7).&lt;/p&gt;

 Dixon and spurs on the team of the
 0:00:20.460,0:00:25.289
 advantage as we go into the second and
 0:00:23.010,0:00:28.470
 decisive leg of this Champions League
 0:00:25.289,0:00:30.750
 semi-final it's every Bay like seat up
 0:00:28.470,0:00:32.430
 against Tottenham Hotspur thank you
 0:00:30.750,0:00:34.170
 doing well Tottenham probably deserve
 0:00:32.430,0:00:36.360
 the lead after that first leg
 0:00:34.170,0:00:37.950
 I thought the temple the game they set I
 0:00:36.360,0:00:39.930
 thought they were brilliant in midfield
 0:00:37.950,0:00:41.620
 but overall they can't afford to switch
 0:00:39.930,0:00:44.920
 off still very very tight
 0:00:41.620,0:00:47.810
 [Applause]

 many year old George brain it does not
 0:01:55.550,0:01:59.110
 work when it works well sometimes you
 0:01:57.920,0:02:03.640
 can just get it
 0:01:59.110,0:02:03.640
 they've got it down to a tee to be fair
 0:02:05.409,0:02:11.000
 Spurs will go with this starting eleven
 0:02:08.599,0:02:13.129
 Mughal or eise begins him go young

 0:02:15.590,0:02:19.690
 they all was dangerous Harry Kay
 0:02:24.319,0:02:28.859
 and they get the ball rolling in the
 0:02:27.060,0:02:31.430
 second leg of this Champions League
 0:02:28.859,0:02:31.430
 semi-final
 0:02:32.680,0:02:40.080
 she clinics
 0:02:35.380,0:02:45.600
 no deep Mookie le Marcel's dummied sir
 0:02:40.080,0:02:45.600
 who's Patrick Sheikh making progress
 0:02:47.319,0:02:55.020
 Lucas Maurier
 0:02:51.910,0:02:55.020
 look elsewhere this
 0:02:56.730,0:03:01.670
 not much time to make up his mind
 0:02:59.780,0:03:04.100
 well you never quite know who's going to
 0:03:01.670,0:03:05.990
 dominate a game in advance but I think
 0:03:04.100,0:03:07.940
 you can maybe make an argument for this
 0:03:05.990,0:03:09.830
 fellow Lee what do you think we'll see
 0:03:07.940,0:03:11.540
 from him but when I look at play I'm
 0:03:09.830,0:03:13.730
 playing against the first thing I look
 0:03:11.540,0:03:15.770
 at is how quick is he and if he is quick
 0:03:13.730,0:03:18.110
 he's got pace I have to play him a
 0:03:15.770,0:03:19.700
 certain way that's my first objective to
 0:03:18.110,0:03:22.180
 stop him getting the ball so he can use
 0:03:19.700,0:03:22.180
 that pace
 0:03:29.769,0:03:35.799
 was respectable but the goalkeeper
 0:03:32.299,0:03:35.799
 always seemed to have it covered
 0:03:36.660,0:03:40.460
 [Applause]
 0:04:01.880,0:04:05.020
 [Applause]
 0:04:10.150,0:04:16.120
 well that is a defenders job to come to
 0:04:12.519,0:04:17.780
 the rescue a good-looking move to the
 0:04:16.120,0:04:21.160
 mechanic
 0:04:17.780,0:04:21.160
 no deep Mickey any
 0:04:21.970,0:04:27.840
 Marcel's a beat sir possession lost
 0:04:30.500,0:04:33.430
 some
 0:04:31.910,0:04:36.680
 [Applause]
 0:04:33.430,0:04:41.350
 a good and fair challenge
 0:04:36.680,0:04:43.590
 so the token
 0:04:41.350,0:04:46.460
 [Applause]
 0:04:43.590,0:04:46.460
 Oh Elsa

 0:04:54.230,0:04:58.350
 authority
 0:04:55.180,0:04:58.350
 [Applause]
 0:04:59.400,0:05:03.690
 the goalkeeper right behind it the only
 0:05:01.860,0:05:06.080
 way to score there goes he decided the
 0:05:03.690,0:05:06.080
 keeper
 0:05:06.840,0:05:09.590
 Adams
 0:05:10.070,0:05:18.180
 forsberg and Sundberg has it bad
 0:05:16.380,0:05:21.330
 challenge and now it's up to the referee
 0:05:18.180,0:05:23.820
 in terms of what to do next and the
 0:05:21.330,0:05:25.440
 referee has determined that that is a
 0:05:23.820,0:05:26.760
 book of an offense I don't think you
 0:05:25.440,0:05:28.670
 could think anything else after that
 0:05:26.760,0:05:35.449
 challenge
 0:05:28.670,0:05:35.449
 [Applause]
 0:05:38.990,0:05:47.620
 [Applause]
 0:05:48.150,0:05:56.810
 and they deal with the threat this time
 0:05:51.860,0:05:58.560
 or ei Delhi alley now look us with it
 0:05:56.810,0:06:01.440

 0:06:07.360,0:06:13.689
 no sensor as clean as a whistle that
 0:06:11.050,0:06:18.009
 challenge on the counter looks on here
 0:06:13.689,0:06:23.289
 options available Lima on the ball
 0:06:18.009,0:06:27.069
 tremendous intuition to win it back okay
 0:06:23.289,0:06:29.590
 well visionary pulsing and a feed for
 0:06:27.069,0:06:32.170
 birds a call for Tottenham Hotspur and
 0:06:29.590,0:06:38.129
 they are gonna be difficult to sort now
 0:06:32.170,0:06:40.319
 [Applause]
 0:06:38.129,0:06:41.999
 while sometimes being in the right place
 0:06:40.319,0:06:44.610
 at the right time gets you a goal on
 0:06:41.999,0:06:47.669
 this occasion is a simple goal from his
 0:06:44.610,0:06:49.849
 point of view a chance to revisit the
 0:06:47.669,0:06:49.849
 goal
 0:06:50.410,0:06:59.990
 [Applause]

 well now on aggregate to nail d'Alene
 0:07:18.400,0:07:21.449
 but giving it away
 0:07:23.390,0:07:32.069
 [Applause]
 0:07:28.169,0:07:34.770
 far from a good pass that's the kind of
 0:07:32.069,0:07:38.610
 shielding play you expect from it and a
 0:07:34.770,0:07:41.719
 strong tackle possession changes hands
 0:07:38.610,0:07:41.719
 they interception there
 0:07:47.120,0:07:56.319
 [Applause]
 0:07:49.520,0:07:56.319
 Forsberg making progress
 0:07:57.919,0:08:01.520
 he's never going to worry the keeper
 0:07:59.749,0:08:03.680
 well no wonder he's looking a little bit
 0:08:01.520,0:08:06.759
 sheepishly at his teammates head in a
 0:08:03.680,0:08:06.759
 handsaw moment
 0:08:23.150,0:08:29.260
 [Music]
 0:08:27.810,0:08:31.480
 [Applause]
 0:08:29.260,0:08:34.650

 0:08:31.480,0:08:34.650

 0:08:34.700,0:08:39.389
 [Applause]
 0:08:39.790,0:08:47.290
 shit with it Lima on the ball referees
 0:08:45.190,0:08:52.010
 verdict is three additional minutes
 0:08:47.290,0:08:58.740
 three minutes from card labor force bag
 0:08:52.010,0:08:58.740
 [Applause]
 0:09:00.120,0:09:05.670
 unable to keep the ball that time so the
 0:09:03.899,0:09:09.079
 whistle then were up the halfway stage
 0:09:05.670,0:09:09.079
 in this match
 0:09:14.780,0:09:21.080
 [Applause]
 0:09:30.870,0:09:35.260
 and they get the ball rolling in the
 0:09:33.430,0:09:44.440
 second leg of this Champions League
 0:09:35.260,0:09:45.940
 semi-final was respectable but the
 0:09:44.440,0:09:54.570
 goalkeeper always seemed to have it
 0:09:45.940,0:09:54.570
 covered I'll stand back as it
 0:09:56.060,0:10:00.740
 and the referee has determined that that
 0:09:58.610,0:10:03.760
 is a book about offense I don't think
 0:10:00.740,0:10:03.760
 you could think anything else
 0:10:05.900,0:10:09.070
 [Applause]
 0:10:09.540,0:10:13.140
 visionary promising
 0:10:13.720,0:10:18.700

 0:10:16.570,0:10:23.310
 Hotspur and they are going to be
 0:10:18.700,0:10:23.310
 difficult to sort now making progress
 0:10:25.970,0:10:30.330
 was never going to worry the keeper well
 0:10:29.010,0:10:32.580
 no wonder is looking a little bit
 0:10:30.330,0:10:35.690
 sheepishly at his teammates heading a
 0:10:32.580,0:10:35.690
 handsaw moment
 0:10:42.819,0:10:48.920
 and they're underway in the second half
 0:10:46.790,0:10:54.980
 of this Champions League semi-final
 0:10:48.920,0:10:56.529

 0:10:58.509,0:11:01.679
 gone out for a throwing
 0:11:03.760,0:11:06.750
 se√±or

 0:12:19.370,0:12:25.790
 Spurs passing it around nicely but what
 0:12:22.490,0:12:27.430
 can they do from here now with Lukas
 0:12:25.790,0:12:30.610
 Klosterman
 0:12:27.430,0:12:31.310
 Marcela Itza this might be ideal for the
 0:12:30.610,0:12:34.480
 counter
 0:12:31.310,0:12:34.480
 [Applause]
 0:12:35.820,0:12:40.380
 like chic now
 0:12:37.660,0:12:43.000

 0:12:40.380,0:12:45.270
 money but strongly into the challenge
 0:12:43.000,0:12:50.580
 and the result is a throwie
 0:12:45.270,0:12:50.580
 and a change for Spurs at this juncture
 0:12:52.750,0:12:55.919
 [Music]
 0:12:57.430,0:13:03.700
 and the cross is very much on Marcel's a

 looks promising bass
 0:13:14.290,0:13:17.610
 they'd be able to play it in behind
 0:13:18.920,0:13:23.199
 they breathing a sigh of relief ball one
 0:13:23.559,0:13:28.689

 0:14:24.030,0:14:30.680
 fifteen minutes remaining Tyler Adams
 0:14:32.459,0:14:36.309
 just as well from the defensive point of
 0:14:35.019,0:14:46.360
 view that he was able to make that
 0:14:36.309,0:14:48.819
 interception al Darrell Brian seson your

 side when you're as comfortable on the

 ball as they are
 0:14:51.360,0:15:03.070
 [Applause]

 the pressure was high and they cut me in
 0:15:06.790,0:15:11.770
 here to sue Eakin 12 they've been
 0:15:09.610,0:15:14.920
 getting a substitute ready and now they

 indirection with that head up he was
 0:15:58.309,0:16:02.299
 under duress the defender just put him
 0:16:00.980,0:16:05.829
 off a little bit but he's worth an
 0:16:02.299,0:16:05.829
 effort if he goes in he's a hero
 0:16:27.970,0:16:35.319
 Danny Olmo with a Eisenberg has it and
 0:16:33.129,0:16:38.050
 just a one minute left in normal time
 0:16:35.319,0:16:42.670
 here and the fog has gone up here
 0:16:38.050,0:16:45.250
 offside the decision boys off for only
 0:16:42.670,0:16:48.990
 just the gamble from the defenders is
 0:16:45.250,0:16:48.990
 paid off the linesman was right
 0:16:49.790,0:17:05.360
 [Applause]
 0:17:03.050,0:17:07.100
 health officials indicated banty of
 0:17:05.360,0:17:09.740
 know-how and the ball shielding
 0:17:07.100,0:17:13.490
 Department Kane
 0:17:09.740,0:17:15.730
 sighs pass intercepted Kane wonderful
 0:17:13.490,0:17:15.730
 chance
 0:17:19.920,0:17:25.550
 blows whistle
 0:17:22.520,0:17:27.230
 are going to the final military to smoke
 0:17:25.550,0:17:30.310
 in the celebrations and quite rightly
 0:17:27.230,0:17:33.120
 sir sometimes semi-finals
 0:17:30.310,0:17:33.120
 she books the plan
 0:17:33.920,0:17:38.580
 I'm very envious of those players look
 0:17:36.570,0:17:40.140
 at them enjoying this moment still work
 0:17:38.580,0:17:43.460
 to be done before they picked that
 0:17:40.140,0:17:43.460
 famous trophy off though
 0:17:45.860,0:17:49.570
 [Applause]
 0:17:58.100,0:18:01.290
 [Music]
 0:18:03.599,0:18:07.989
 now they get the ball rolling in the
 0:18:06.159,0:18:16.450
 second leg of this Champions League
 0:18:07.989,0:18:18.549
 semi-final the Heather was respectable
 0:18:16.450,0:18:19.950
 but the goalkeeper always seemed to have
 0:18:18.549,0:18:23.359
 it covered
 0:18:19.950,0:18:23.359
 [Applause]
 0:18:23.669,0:18:27.149
 Iceland Benghazi
 0:18:28.830,0:18:33.480
 and the referee has determined that that
 0:18:31.320,0:18:36.500
 is a book above offense I don't think
 0:18:33.480,0:18:36.500
 you could think anything else
 0:18:42.070,0:18:45.900
 well visionary pouncing
 0:18:46.480,0:18:51.670
 and a pain moments a call for Tottenham
 0:18:49.300,0:18:55.770
 Hotspur and they are gonna be difficult
 0:18:51.670,0:18:55.770
 to sort now making progress
 0:18:59.010,0:19:02.790
 it was never going to worry the keeper
 0:19:01.140,0:19:05.040
 well no wonder is looking a little bit
 0:19:02.790,0:19:08.150
 sheepishly at his teammates head in a
 0:19:05.040,0:19:08.150
 handsaw moment
 0:19:20.810,0:19:25.080
 lacking in direction with that header he
 0:19:23.670,0:19:26.970
 was under duress
 0:19:25.080,0:19:30.260
 yeah defender just put him off a little
 0:19:26.970,0:19:30.260
 bit but his Worthen ethic&lt;/pre&gt;</content><author><name>admin</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
