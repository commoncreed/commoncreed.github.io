<p>RB Leipzig vs Tottenham<br />
UEFA Champions League | Round of 16 | Leg 2 of 2 | 2019/20<br />
Stadium : Red Bull Arena</p>

<p>This will be the first encounter between Tottenham and RB Leipzig. It‚Äôs also the first time the team from Leipzig is facing an English club in a competitive fixture whilst Spurs will be facing German opposition in the UCL round of 16 for the second consecutive season, after knocking out Borussia Dortmund 4-0 on aggregate in 2018/19.</p>

<p>The only previous game between Tottenham and a German team at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium ended in a 7-2 win for Bayern Munich, back in October this season.</p>

<p>In fact, Tottenham‚Äôs two Champions League games against German opposition this season have produced 13 goals. Finalists in 2018/19, Tottenham are in the knockout stages of the Champions League for the third consecutive season ‚Äì they had only made it past the group phase once before (2010/11).</p>

<p>RB Leipzig have reached the Champions League knockout stages for the first time in their history. Wolfsburg are the last German team ‚Äì outside of Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund ‚Äì to make it past the round of 16, back in 2015/16.</p>

<p>Tottenham conceded 14 goals in this season‚Äôs Champions League group phase, the highest tally among the remaining teams in the competition. Half of those goals came in their home game against Bayern Munich (2-7).</p>

 night for football the floodlights

 I'm Derek ray here on the commentary box
 0:00:15.809,0:00:20.460
 and I'm joined for commentary by Lee
 0:00:18.330,0:00:23.010
 Dixon and spurs on the team of the
 0:00:20.460,0:00:25.289
 advantage as we go into the second and
 0:00:23.010,0:00:28.470
 decisive leg of this Champions League
 0:00:25.289,0:00:30.750
 semi-final it's every Bay like seat up
 0:00:28.470,0:00:32.430
 against Tottenham Hotspur thank you
 0:00:30.750,0:00:34.170
 doing well Tottenham probably deserve
 0:00:32.430,0:00:36.360
 the lead after that first leg
 0:00:34.170,0:00:37.950
 I thought the temple the game they set I
 0:00:36.360,0:00:39.930
 thought they were brilliant in midfield
 0:00:37.950,0:00:41.620
 but overall they can't afford to switch
 0:00:39.930,0:00:44.920
 off still very very tight
 0:00:41.620,0:00:47.810
 [Applause]

 energy played the system a harsh for
 0:01:53.120,0:01:57.920
 many year old George brain it does not
 0:01:55.550,0:01:59.110
 work when it works well sometimes you
 0:01:57.920,0:02:03.640
 can just get it
 0:01:59.110,0:02:03.640
 they've got it down to a tee to be fair
 0:02:05.409,0:02:11.000
 Spurs will go with this starting eleven
 0:02:08.599,0:02:13.129
 Mughal or eise begins him go young

 0:02:15.590,0:02:19.690
 they all was dangerous Harry Kay
 0:02:24.319,0:02:28.859
 and they get the ball rolling in the
 0:02:27.060,0:02:31.430
 second leg of this Champions League
 0:02:28.859,0:02:31.430
 semi-final
 0:02:32.680,0:02:40.080
 she clinics
 0:02:35.380,0:02:45.600
 no deep Mookie le Marcel's dummied sir
 0:02:40.080,0:02:45.600
 who's Patrick Sheikh making progress
 0:02:47.319,0:02:55.020
 Lucas Maurier
 0:02:51.910,0:02:55.020
 look elsewhere this
 0:02:56.730,0:03:01.670
 not much time to make up his mind
 0:02:59.780,0:03:04.100
 well you never quite know who's going to
 0:03:01.670,0:03:05.990
 dominate a game in advance but I think
 0:03:04.100,0:03:07.940
 you can maybe make an argument for this
 0:03:05.990,0:03:09.830
 fellow Lee what do you think we'll see
 0:03:07.940,0:03:11.540
 from him but when I look at play I'm
 0:03:09.830,0:03:13.730
 playing against the first thing I look
 0:03:11.540,0:03:15.770
 at is how quick is he and if he is quick
 0:03:13.730,0:03:18.110
 he's got pace I have to play him a
 0:03:15.770,0:03:19.700
 certain way that's my first objective to
 0:03:18.110,0:03:22.180
 stop him getting the ball so he can use
 0:03:19.700,0:03:22.180
 that pace
 0:03:29.769,0:03:35.799
 was respectable but the goalkeeper
 0:03:32.299,0:03:35.799
 always seemed to have it covered
 0:03:36.660,0:03:40.460
 [Applause]
 0:04:01.880,0:04:05.020
 [Applause]
 0:04:10.150,0:04:16.120
 well that is a defenders job to come to
 0:04:12.519,0:04:17.780
 the rescue a good-looking move to the
 0:04:16.120,0:04:21.160
 mechanic
 0:04:17.780,0:04:21.160
 no deep Mickey any
 0:04:21.970,0:04:27.840
 Marcel's a beat sir possession lost
 0:04:30.500,0:04:33.430
 some
 0:04:31.910,0:04:36.680
 [Applause]
 0:04:33.430,0:04:41.350
 a good and fair challenge
 0:04:36.680,0:04:43.590
 so the token
 0:04:41.350,0:04:46.460
 [Applause]
 0:04:43.590,0:04:46.460

 0:04:54.230,0:04:58.350
 authority
 0:04:55.180,0:04:58.350
 [Applause]
 0:04:59.400,0:05:03.690
 the goalkeeper right behind it the only
 0:05:01.860,0:05:06.080
 way to score there goes he decided the
 0:05:03.690,0:05:06.080
 keeper
 0:05:06.840,0:05:09.590
 Adams
 0:05:10.070,0:05:18.180
 forsberg and Sundberg has it bad
 0:05:16.380,0:05:21.330
 challenge and now it's up to the referee
 0:05:18.180,0:05:23.820
 in terms of what to do next and the
 0:05:21.330,0:05:25.440
 referee has determined that that is a
 0:05:23.820,0:05:26.760
 book of an offense I don't think you
 0:05:25.440,0:05:28.670
 could think anything else after that
 0:05:26.760,0:05:35.449
 challenge
 0:05:28.670,0:05:35.449
 [Applause]
 0:05:38.990,0:05:47.620
 [Applause]
 0:05:48.150,0:05:56.810

 0:06:11.050,0:06:18.009
 challenge on the counter looks on here
 0:06:13.689,0:06:23.289
 options available Lima on the ball
 0:06:18.009,0:06:27.069
 tremendous intuition to win it back okay
 0:06:23.289,0:06:29.590
 well visionary pulsing and a feed for
 0:06:27.069,0:06:32.170

 0:06:32.170,0:06:40.319
 [Applause]
 0:06:38.129,0:06:41.999
 while sometimes being in the right place
 0:06:40.319,0:06:44.610
 at the right time gets you a goal on
 0:06:41.999,0:06:47.669
 this occasion is a simple goal from his
 0:06:44.610,0:06:49.849
 point of view a chance to revisit the
 0:06:47.669,0:06:49.849
 goal
 0:06:50.410,0:06:59.990
 [Applause]

 0:07:18.400,0:07:21.449
 but giving it away
 0:07:23.390,0:07:32.069
 [Applause]
 0:07:28.169,0:07:34.770
 far from a good pass that's the kind of
 0:07:32.069,0:07:38.610
 shielding play you expect from it and a
 0:07:34.770,0:07:41.719
 strong tackle possession changes hands
 0:07:38.610,0:07:41.719
 they interception there

 [Applause]
 0:07:49.520,0:07:56.319
 Forsberg making progress
 0:07:57.919,0:08:01.520
 he's never going to worry the keeper
 0:07:59.749,0:08:03.680
 well no wonder he's looking a little bit
 0:08:01.520,0:08:06.759
 sheepishly at his teammates head in a
 0:08:03.680,0:08:06.759
 handsaw moment
 0:08:23.150,0:08:29.260
 [Music]
 0:08:27.810,0:08:31.480
 [Applause]
 0:08:29.260,0:08:34.650

 0:08:39.790,0:08:47.290
 shit with it Lima on the ball referees
 0:08:45.190,0:08:52.010
 verdict is three additional minutes
 0:08:47.290,0:08:58.740
 three minutes from card labor force bag
 0:08:52.010,0:08:58.740
 [Applause]
 0:09:00.120,0:09:05.670
 unable to keep the ball that time so the
 0:09:03.899,0:09:09.079
 whistle then were up the halfway stage
 0:09:05.670,0:09:09.079
 in this match
 0:09:14.780,0:09:21.080
 [Applause]
 0:09:30.870,0:09:35.260
 and they get the ball rolling in the
 0:09:33.430,0:09:44.440
 second leg of this Champions League
 0:09:35.260,0:09:45.940
 semi-final was respectable but the
 0:09:44.440,0:09:54.570
 goalkeeper always seemed to have it
 0:09:45.940,0:09:54.570
 covered I'll stand back as it
 0:09:56.060,0:10:00.740
 and the referee has determined that that
 0:09:58.610,0:10:03.760
 is a book about offense I don't think
 0:10:00.740,0:10:03.760
 you could think anything else
 0:10:05.900,0:10:09.070
 [Applause]

 0:10:18.700,0:10:23.310
 difficult to sort now making progress
 0:10:25.970,0:10:30.330
 was never going to worry the keeper well
 0:10:29.010,0:10:32.580
 no wonder is looking a little bit
 0:10:30.330,0:10:35.690
 sheepishly at his teammates heading a
 0:10:32.580,0:10:35.690
 handsaw moment
 0:10:42.819,0:10:48.920
 and they're underway in the second half

 0:10:58.509,0:11:01.679
 gone out for a throwing
 0:11:03.760,0:11:06.750

 0:12:25.790,0:12:30.610
 Klosterman
 0:12:27.430,0:12:31.310
 Marcela Itza this might be ideal for the
 0:12:30.610,0:12:34.480
 counter
 0:12:31.310,0:12:34.480
 [Applause]

 0:12:40.380,0:12:45.270
 money but strongly into the challenge
 0:12:43.000,0:12:50.580
 and the result is a throwie
 0:12:45.270,0:12:50.580
 and a change for Spurs at this juncture
 0:12:52.750,0:12:55.919
 [Music]

 0:13:14.290,0:13:17.610

 completely overheats
 0:14:24.030,0:14:30.680
 fifteen minutes remaining Tyler Adams
 0:14:32.459,0:14:36.309
 just as well from the defensive point of
 0:14:35.019,0:14:46.360
 view that he was able to make that
 0:14:36.309,0:14:48.819
 interception al Darrell Brian seson your
 0:14:46.360,0:14:50.529
 Haziq but it's a great advantage to any
 0:14:48.819,0:14:51.360
 side when you're as comfortable on the
 0:14:50.529,0:14:59.540
 ball as they are
 0:14:51.360,0:15:03.070
 [Applause]
 0:14:59.540,0:15:03.070
 not much time to make up his mind
 0:15:04.420,0:15:09.610
 the pressure was high and they cut me in
 0:15:06.790,0:15:11.770
 here to sue Eakin 12 they've been
 0:15:09.610,0:15:14.920
 getting a substitute ready and now they
 0:15:11.770,0:15:17.580
 will make the personnel change coming
 0:15:14.920,0:15:17.580
 onto the page
 0:15:19.600,0:15:22.739
 [Applause]
 0:15:23.870,0:15:28.820
 Polson opportunity to deliver the cross
 0:15:26.950,0:15:32.129
 what can we do from here
 0:15:28.820,0:15:32.129
 [Applause]
 0:15:32.880,0:15:38.010
 that's well blocks well they got the
 0:15:35.730,0:15:41.670
 touch on the ball and so a corner it'll
 0:15:38.010,0:15:43.820
 be substitution time as is

 thrown a kick played over lacking
 0:15:56.209,0:16:00.980
 indirection with that head up he was
 0:15:58.309,0:16:02.299
 under duress the defender just put him
 0:16:00.980,0:16:05.829
 off a little bit but he's worth an
 0:16:02.299,0:16:05.829
 effort if he goes in he's a hero
 0:16:27.970,0:16:35.319
 Danny Olmo with a Eisenberg has it and
 0:16:33.129,0:16:38.050
 just a one minute left in normal time
 0:16:35.319,0:16:42.670

 0:16:38.050,0:16:45.250
 offside the decision boys off for only
 0:16:42.670,0:16:48.990
 just the gamble from the defenders is
 0:16:45.250,0:16:48.990
 paid off the linesman was right
 0:16:49.790,0:17:05.360
 [Applause]
 0:17:03.050,0:17:07.100
 health officials indicated banty of

 0:17:25.550,0:17:30.310
 in the celebrations and quite rightly
 0:17:27.230,0:17:33.120
 sir sometimes semi-finals
 0:17:30.310,0:17:33.120
 she books the plan
 0:17:33.920,0:17:38.580
 I'm very envious of those players look
 0:17:36.570,0:17:40.140
 at them enjoying this moment still work
 0:17:38.580,0:17:43.460
 to be done before they picked that
 0:17:40.140,0:17:43.460
 famous trophy off though
 0:17:45.860,0:17:49.570
 [Applause]
 0:17:58.100,0:18:01.290
 [Music]
 0:18:03.599,0:18:07.989
 now they get the ball rolling in the
 0:18:06.159,0:18:16.450
 second leg of this Champions League
 0:18:07.989,0:18:18.549
 semi-final the Heather was respectable
 0:18:16.450,0:18:19.950
 but the goalkeeper always seemed to have
 0:18:18.549,0:18:23.359
 it covered
 0:18:19.950,0:18:23.359
 [Applause]
 0:18:23.669,0:18:27.149
 Iceland Benghazi
 0:18:28.830,0:18:33.480
 and the referee has determined that that
 0:18:31.320,0:18:36.500
 is a book above offense I don't think
 0:18:33.480,0:18:36.500
 you could think anything else
 0:18:42.070,0:18:45.900
 well visionary pouncing
 0:18:46.480,0:18:51.670
 and a pain moments a call for Tottenham
 0:18:49.300,0:18:55.770
 Hotspur and they are gonna be difficult
 0:18:51.670,0:18:55.770
 to sort now making progress
 0:18:59.010,0:19:02.790
 it was never going to worry the keeper
 0:19:01.140,0:19:05.040
 well no wonder is looking a little bit
 0:19:02.790,0:19:08.150
 sheepishly at his teammates head in a
 0:19:05.040,0:19:08.150
 handsaw moment
 0:19:20.810,0:19:25.080
 lacking in direction with that header he
 0:19:23.670,0:19:26.970
 was under duress
 0:19:25.080,0:19:30.260
 yeah defender just put him off a little
 0:19:26.970,0:19:30.260
 bit but his Worthen ethic</pre>
