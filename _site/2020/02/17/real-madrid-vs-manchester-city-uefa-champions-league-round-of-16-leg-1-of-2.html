 forward to Real Madrid against
 0:00:19.439,0:00:23.490
 Manchester City Real Madrid Champions
 0:00:21.330,0:00:25.019
 League royalty Manchester City would
 0:00:23.490,0:00:26.880
 love to be able to emulate them ly
 0:00:25.019,0:00:29.039
 absolutely they've been the envy of
 0:00:26.880,0:00:31.109
 everybody looking from below Real Madrid
 0:00:29.039,0:00:33.809
 with their history can city so
 0:00:31.109,0:00:36.050
 domestically successful following their
 0:00:33.809,0:00:36.050
 footsteps
 0:00:42.110,0:01:10.379

 0:01:18.230,0:01:23.720
 [Music]
 0:01:20.960,0:01:26.119
 Reyat Madrid well there's no great
 0:01:23.720,0:01:28.220
 mystery is there we know normally how
 0:01:26.119,0:01:30.260
 they're going to play and it's all about
 0:01:28.220,0:01:32.900
 applying as much pressure as possible
 0:01:30.260,0:01:34.880
 Lee can we anticipate seeing more of the
 0:01:32.900,0:01:36.470
 same today yeah absolutely Derrick if
 0:01:34.880,0:01:38.690
 you're really good at something then why
 0:01:36.470,0:01:40.640
 not they're very good at this all the
 0:01:38.690,0:01:43.009
 team members have bought into this style
 0:01:40.640,0:01:44.200
 of play one player slacks off and it
 0:01:43.009,0:01:47.389
 will falls apart though
 0:01:44.200,0:01:47.389
 [Music]
 0:01:48.260,0:01:53.580
 santiago bernabeu you might be asking he
 0:01:51.270,0:01:55.860
 was involved of real madrid for a long
 0:01:53.580,0:01:58.610
 time as a player director of football
 0:01:55.860,0:02:00.690
 coach manager club president from 1911
 0:01:58.610,0:02:02.970
 until 1978
 0:02:00.690,0:02:05.490
 yeah the steep-sided stands here I
 0:02:02.970,0:02:09.229
 believe create a unique atmosphere in
 0:02:05.490,0:02:11.730
 European football's absolutely brilliant
 0:02:09.229,0:02:14.070
 introducing the starting players for
 0:02:11.730,0:02:16.410
 Manchester City the Brazilian Edison
 0:02:14.070,0:02:18.720
 starts in go Alexandra seam chenko
 0:02:16.410,0:02:21.150
 starts with Kyle Walker as fullbacks
 0:02:18.720,0:02:23.970
 Raheem Sterling place with riyad mahrez
 0:02:21.150,0:02:27.080
 on the flanks and leading the line is
 0:02:23.970,0:02:27.080
 Sergio ag√ºero
 0:02:32.400,0:02:35.569
 here's Kappa house
 0:02:35.709,0:02:40.800
 casimiro
 0:02:37.810,0:02:40.800
 Tony closed
 0:02:42.590,0:02:45.370
 as odd
 0:02:45.599,0:02:52.580
 as our course
 0:02:49.100,0:02:54.790
 but says Sergio Ramos every pass hitting
 0:02:52.580,0:02:54.790
 its target
 0:02:55.650,0:03:02.579
 as joy for the Merengues rail the dread
 0:03:00.510,0:03:04.709
 of scores well they pushed and pushed
 0:03:02.579,0:03:08.159
 they tested and tested and they got
 0:03:04.709,0:03:10.200
 their award well it's just great play
 0:03:08.159,0:03:12.060
 Derek the movement off the ball is key
 0:03:10.200,0:03:14.700
 so many options for the passage to
 0:03:12.060,0:03:17.069
 choose from lovely gone
 0:03:14.700,0:03:18.800
 a different vantage point in terms of
 0:03:17.069,0:03:22.050
 the goal that the score
 0:03:18.800,0:03:22.050
 [Applause]
 0:03:29.570,0:03:32.699
 [Applause]
 0:03:38.140,0:03:42.490
 under way again with Real Madrid in
 0:03:40.540,0:03:45.610
 front
 0:03:42.490,0:03:45.610
 [Applause]
 0:03:47.960,0:03:55.920
 david silva sterling has it
 0:03:53.030,0:03:58.530
 Alexandra zinchenko good-looking ball
 0:03:55.920,0:04:00.360
 there could be a Chester as an attacking
 0:03:58.530,0:04:02.730
 player you rather hope you'll get the
 0:04:00.360,0:04:04.650
 decision in your favor but offside here
 0:04:02.730,0:04:07.580
 yeah the defense got that spots on and
 0:04:04.650,0:04:07.580
 so did the linesman
 0:04:11.599,0:04:21.049
 rapha√´l Varane capital
 0:04:15.940,0:04:23.240
 yes Ramos 2018-2019 was a big success
 0:04:21.049,0:04:25.009
 story for Manchester City but the was
 0:04:23.240,0:04:26.690
 heartbreak in the Champions League at
 0:04:25.009,0:04:28.699
 the quarter-final stage against Spurs
 0:04:26.690,0:04:30.979
 Lee now one of the best games of the
 0:04:28.699,0:04:33.110
 competition no doubt about that settled
 0:04:30.979,0:04:35.599
 by two var moments you have to say
 0:04:33.110,0:04:37.789
 Sterling's offside in Laurentiis allowed
 0:04:35.599,0:04:40.039
 goal book what an advertisement for
 0:04:37.789,0:04:41.599
 football var coming into the knockout
 0:04:40.039,0:04:47.030
 stages of the Champions League for the
 0:04:41.599,0:04:48.860
 first time just straying offside well
 0:04:47.030,0:04:52.690
 there it is again he's just a little bit
 0:04:48.860,0:04:52.690
 too eager needs to hold his run a little
 0:05:11.320,0:05:14.889
 [Applause]
 0:05:22.719,0:05:25.529
 woke up
 0:05:25.820,0:05:30.460
 the blind you know Marez and now Kevin
 0:05:29.360,0:05:33.460
 de Bruyne er
 0:05:30.460,0:05:33.460
 ag√ºero
 0:05:33.520,0:05:36.690
 [Applause]
 0:05:37.210,0:05:41.460
 for pass under no real pressure
 0:05:41.540,0:05:46.360
 and sterling has it
 0:05:44.650,0:05:50.140
 well he knew he had to get to the ball
 0:05:46.360,0:05:54.019
 and he did it is to be a throwing
 0:05:50.140,0:05:54.019
 [Applause]
 0:05:57.639,0:06:13.029
 mr. Itami Silva
 0:05:59.360,0:06:13.029
 [Applause]
 0:06:14.290,0:06:22.000
 here's camper Hal now just couldn't keep
 0:06:17.140,0:06:23.570
 the ball Sterling
 0:06:22.000,0:06:25.960
 back from the byline
 0:06:23.570,0:06:28.240
 [Applause]
 0:06:25.960,0:06:30.850
 it wasn't far away from the target late
 0:06:28.240,0:06:32.530
 no it was decent really really decent
 0:06:30.850,0:06:36.330
 chance for the lat they'll keep pushing
 0:06:32.530,0:06:36.330
 away to try and get that equalizer
 0:06:38.930,0:06:46.619
 [Applause]
 0:06:49.550,0:06:52.709
 [Applause]
 0:06:54.840,0:06:58.160
 mrs. Gareth Bale
 0:06:59.110,0:07:04.260
 [Applause]
 0:07:01.830,0:07:06.800
 and Manchester City moving the ball with
 0:07:04.260,0:07:06.800
 purpose
 0:07:08.860,0:07:13.030
 Alexandr zinchenko when they stopped
 0:07:11.960,0:07:17.820
 them in their tracks
 0:07:13.030,0:07:17.820
 [Applause]
 0:07:18.470,0:07:24.160
 sterling and they'll get ready for the
 0:07:21.770,0:07:24.160
 throw-in
 0:07:27.930,0:07:34.530
 hunting a player's waiting in the middle
 0:07:30.259,0:07:36.500
 now scene chenko he's in control of the
 0:07:34.530,0:07:38.719
 situation
 0:07:36.500,0:07:40.279
 [Applause]
 0:07:38.719,0:07:42.759
 good position on the pitch to be
 0:07:40.279,0:07:45.679
 pressing and winning the ball matters
 0:07:42.759,0:07:49.929
 and that's what they needed man Jesus si
 0:07:45.679,0:07:49.929
 a goal to level matters here
 0:07:54.700,0:07:58.960
 well as we look at this again what they
 0:07:56.560,0:08:00.910
 always say focus on the ball and sure
 0:07:58.960,0:08:03.940
 you strike it cleanly he's done just
 0:08:00.910,0:08:07.200
 that what a finish let's have another
 0:08:03.940,0:08:07.200
 view of that goal
 0:08:08.880,0:08:14.650
 [Applause]
 0:08:11.580,0:08:16.690
 well Derek the frustrations boiling over
 0:08:14.650,0:08:20.040
 on the touchline is not happy at all
 0:08:16.690,0:08:20.040
 over the last five or ten minutes
 0:08:25.870,0:08:31.180
 well the earlier girl cancelled out one
 0:08:28.879,0:08:31.180
 apiece
 0:08:34.169,0:08:38.000
 Real Madrid have given us away
 0:08:40.540,0:08:44.820
 but all with Audrey stones
 0:08:45.260,0:08:49.450
 job done defensively by Marcelo
 0:08:54.850,0:08:58.740
 the brainer
 0:08:55.950,0:09:01.540
 [Applause]
 0:08:58.740,0:09:05.320
 very attractive-looking moved easy on
 0:09:01.540,0:09:07.510
 the eye but nothing there well this
 0:09:05.320,0:09:08.300
 isn't exactly new territory for Real
 0:09:07.510,0:09:10.730
 Madrid
 0:09:08.300,0:09:13.520
 more semi-final appearances than any
 0:09:10.730,0:09:15.110
 other team and they expect successfully
 0:09:13.520,0:09:16.460
 while they're doing when you played in
 0:09:15.110,0:09:18.470
 so many semi fires it doesn't half
 0:09:16.460,0:09:19.940
 settle the nerves before thought there
 0:09:18.470,0:09:21.830
 will be players in that dressing room a
 0:09:19.940,0:09:23.900
 little bit nervous about controlling
 0:09:21.830,0:09:26.150
 your nerves controlling your emotions
 0:09:23.900,0:09:26.830
 and going out and doing your job simple
 0:09:26.150,0:09:29.180
 as that
 0:09:26.830,0:09:31.520
 we've been waiting to find out now we
 0:09:29.180,0:09:33.730
 know a minimum of three added minutes
 0:09:31.520,0:09:33.730
 here
 0:09:33.760,0:09:42.390
 Samira
 0:09:35.910,0:09:45.570
 and that's an important intervention the
 0:09:42.390,0:09:49.490
 brain it and the first harbours in the
 0:09:45.570,0:09:49.490
 history books here at the bernab√©u
 0:09:50.940,0:09:54.870
 you certainly got to give this man high
 0:09:52.830,0:09:57.060
 marks for his work up to this point Lee
 0:09:54.870,0:09:58.920
 well he's been involved in most of the
 0:09:57.060,0:10:00.870
 positive things in that first half and
 0:09:58.920,0:10:02.820
 obviously getting that goal is giving
 0:10:00.870,0:10:05.000
 his team a huge boost for this second
 0:10:02.820,0:10:05.000
 half

 be a very tight tense contest and
 0:15:56.130,0:15:59.850
 leading so that's exactly how things
 0:15:58.080,0:16:01.200
 turned out well it's a bit of an
 0:15:59.850,0:16:02.940
 understatement to say we're at the
 0:16:01.200,0:16:05.520
 business end of the competition
 0:16:02.940,0:16:07.290

 0:16:05.520,0:16:09.270
 first leg was a good one
 0:16:07.290,0:16:13.460
 second leg has to be a better one
 0:16:09.270,0:16:13.460
 because there's a final round the corner
