<p>Valencia vs Atalanta<br />
UEFA Champions League | Round of 16 | Leg 2 of 2 | 2019/20<br />
Stadium : Mestalla</p>

<p>This will be the first encounter between Atalanta and Valencia. It‚Äôs also the first time the team from Bergamo will face Spanish opposition in a competitive fixture.</p>

<p>Valencia have won only one of their eight away games against Italian opposition in the Champions League (D2 L5), a 1-0 victory against Roma in the 2002/03 second group stages.</p>

<p>They have also failed to find the net in six of those eight games. Atalanta are the first Champions League debutant to make it to the knockout stages of the Champions League since Leicester City in 2016/17 ‚Äì the English side were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals by Atl√©tico Madrid.</p>

<p>Under the current format (since 2003/04), Atalanta are the first team to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League after losing their opening three group games.</p>

<p>Atalanta won two of their six games in this season‚Äôs Champions League group phase (against Dinamo Zagreb and Shakhtar Donetsk), the lowest tally alongside Lyon among the 16 remaining teams.</p>

 0:00:21.359,0:00:26.519
 to look forward to is the second leg of
 0:00:23.760,0:00:29.970

 0:00:34.170,0:00:38.579
 that first leg what do the home side do
 0:00:36.329,0:00:40.079
 what the away side to for they attack
 0:00:38.579,0:00:41.810
 from the start they need to put the
 0:00:40.079,0:00:42.880
 pressure on
 0:00:41.810,0:00:47.970
 [Applause]
 0:00:42.880,0:00:48.880
 [Music]
 0:00:47.970,0:01:17.060

 [Applause]
 0:01:17.970,0:01:23.160
 [Music]
 0:01:20.220,0:01:25.650
 poor Valencia Ezequiel Garay plays
 0:01:23.160,0:01:26.700
 alongside Gabrielle Paulista in the
 0:01:25.650,0:01:29.160
 center of the fence
 0:01:26.700,0:01:31.530
 Danny pareja starts with Francis Coppola
 0:01:29.160,0:01:33.660
 in the centre of midfield and so many
 0:01:31.530,0:01:37.730
 different ways to configure an attack in
 0:01:33.660,0:01:37.730
 this case it'll be to man up front
 0:01:50.480,0:01:55.189
 [Applause]
 0:02:03.510,0:02:08.610
 we're starting a lemon for Atalanta
 0:02:06.020,0:02:10.200
 wing-backs are important on this set up
 0:02:08.610,0:02:12.000
 that you enjoy your experience of
 0:02:10.200,0:02:14.040
 playing at Wing Batley not at all in the
 0:02:12.000,0:02:16.110
 Bruce Rock answer very very demanding
 0:02:14.040,0:02:18.380
 role as we can see the full-backs are
 0:02:16.110,0:02:21.240
 exposed both offensively and defensively
 0:02:18.380,0:02:22.800
 lots of support inside them but going
 0:02:21.240,0:02:26.330
 forward they need to try and get the
 0:02:22.800,0:02:26.330
 ball into the box for the two up front
 0:02:29.870,0:02:36.519
 and Torres on the ball is with Lorenzi
 0:02:33.519,0:02:36.519
 Rodrigo

 0:02:39.090,0:02:44.110
 [Applause]
 0:02:42.010,0:02:48.000
 they knew what he was doing defensively
 0:02:44.110,0:02:48.000
 with the concession of that throwing
 0:02:48.660,0:02:56.010
 and space for the cross
 0:02:51.970,0:02:56.010
 and the referee says corner-kick
 0:03:02.950,0:03:06.250
 [Applause]
 0:03:09.900,0:03:15.390
 and overcomes the corner the idea was to
 0:03:13.319,0:03:22.780
 get the corner beyond the first offender
 0:03:15.390,0:03:25.330
 but he didn't succeed he Lachish Zapata

 0:03:40.689,0:03:47.290
 at Team cz now a highly purposeful
 0:03:44.859,0:03:51.370
 attack place the emphasis on getting the
 0:03:47.290,0:03:53.450
 ball forward this might be ideal for the
 0:03:51.370,0:03:55.240
