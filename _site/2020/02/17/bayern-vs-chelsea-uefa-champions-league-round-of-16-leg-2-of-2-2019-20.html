 0:00:06.470,0:00:11.460
 hello and a warm welcome on what is a
 0:00:09.000,0:00:14.370
 glorious night for football perfect
 0:00:11.460,0:00:16.289
 playing conditions I'm Jerry Gray joined
 0:00:14.370,0:00:18.330
 here on the commentary box as always by
 0:00:16.289,0:00:20.580
 Lee Dixon and what we have to look
 0:00:18.330,0:00:23.789
 forward to is the second leg of this
 0:00:20.580,0:00:26.880
 Champions League semi-final it is Bayern
 0:00:23.789,0:00:29.160
 Munich taking on Chelsea thanks Derek
 0:00:26.880,0:00:30.510
 yes a good first leg wasn't it plenty of
 0:00:29.160,0:00:32.640
 action both ends
 0:00:30.510,0:00:34.860
 nothing to choose between the two teams
 0:00:32.640,0:00:37.079
 we got some goals will we get some more
 0:00:34.860,0:00:40.520
 tonight pretty sure we will hopefully
 0:00:37.079,0:00:40.520
 we're not disappointed
 0:00:41.240,0:00:47.750
 [Applause]
 0:00:44.310,0:00:48.610
 [Music]
 0:00:47.750,0:01:17.080
 [Applause]
 0:00:48.610,0:01:20.100
 [Music]
 0:01:17.080,0:01:23.740
 [Applause]
 0:01:20.100,0:01:26.800
 for buyer Manuel Neuer begins him go
 0:01:23.740,0:01:28.630
 David Alaba plays with Jerome Boateng in
 0:01:26.800,0:01:32.760
 central defense and leading the attack
 0:01:28.630,0:01:41.960
 today is the lethal Robert Lewandowski
 0:01:32.760,0:01:44.150
 [Applause]
 0:01:41.960,0:01:45.740
 I'm interested ly and finding out what
 0:01:44.150,0:01:47.510
 was uppermost in your mind when you
 0:01:45.740,0:01:49.430
 faced by and as a player well I think
 0:01:47.510,0:01:52.010
 it's very stereotypical to look at
 0:01:49.430,0:01:54.050
 German footballers and say they're very
 0:01:52.010,0:01:55.670
 machine-like when they play but whenever
 0:01:54.050,0:01:57.800
 I played against Bayern Munich it was
 0:01:55.670,0:02:00.200
 always a case of looking at the team and
 0:01:57.800,0:02:02.210
 finding no weaknesses there's no areas
 0:02:00.200,0:02:04.990
 of the team where you can exploit and I
 0:02:02.210,0:02:08.270
 think that's their biggest strength
 0:02:04.990,0:02:10.880
 here's the lineup for Chelsea Kephart
 0:02:08.270,0:02:13.130
 is given the green light in goal andreas
 0:02:10.880,0:02:15.260
 Kristensen plays with Antonio r√ºdiger
 0:02:13.130,0:02:17.989
 and central defence and Gotha Conte
 0:02:15.260,0:02:20.360
 stands alongside Giorgio in the centre
 0:02:17.989,0:02:22.459
 of midfield and the idea is to have just
 0:02:20.360,0:02:25.810
 the one striker up there trying to pose
 0:02:22.459,0:02:25.810
 problems for the opposition
 0:02:31.990,0:02:34.920
 here's Thiago
 0:02:35.710,0:02:40.850
 while many have remarked upon the hosts
 0:02:38.870,0:02:42.830
 and the preferred style which is one of
 0:02:40.850,0:02:44.900
 high pressing and trying to get the ball
 0:02:42.830,0:02:47.000
 back quickly Lee do you expect to see
 0:02:44.900,0:02:48.590
 more of that in this game yes deric high
 0:02:47.000,0:02:50.450
 pressing is their game but there is a
 0:02:48.590,0:02:52.760
 risk attached to it if the opposition
 0:02:50.450,0:02:57.910
 break through that press early on you
 0:02:52.760,0:02:57.910
 can be left vulnerable at the back Munna
 0:03:01.950,0:03:05.030
 fixing opportunity
 0:03:05.590,0:03:12.090
 Munna and Pavan on the
 0:03:08.710,0:03:12.090
 don't ski in the thick of things
 0:03:15.349,0:03:18.370
 go ahead Scott
 0:03:21.420,0:03:28.550
 passing it around with a flaw
 0:03:24.920,0:03:30.410
 it's a goal kick are the mere mention of
 0:03:28.550,0:03:32.569
 the name of Albert levin dosti can have
 0:03:30.410,0:03:34.640
 the effect of striking fear in opposing
 0:03:32.569,0:03:36.470
 defenses Lee what do you expect to see
 0:03:34.640,0:03:38.360
 from him today he's on the ball all the
 0:03:36.470,0:03:40.700
 time and his ability on the ball is
 0:03:38.360,0:03:42.290
 absolutely phenomenal he doesn't pass
 0:03:40.700,0:03:44.360
 the ball away he lends it to his
 0:03:42.290,0:03:48.910
 teammates because he wants it back very
 0:03:44.360,0:03:51.080
 difficult to get the ball off him Thiago
 0:03:48.910,0:03:54.160
 that's enough people
 0:03:51.080,0:03:57.060
 Serg can happily
 0:03:54.160,0:03:57.060
 that's a no toy
 0:04:01.530,0:04:06.440
 here's coverage beautifully disguise
 0:04:04.200,0:04:09.050
 ball
 0:04:06.440,0:04:11.440
 typical of William to be wasteful as he
 0:04:09.050,0:04:11.440
 was then
 0:04:14.440,0:04:18.100
 Serge Canaveral
 0:04:20.340,0:04:25.310
 Tiago now she's gonna do from this
 0:04:22.800,0:04:25.310
 position
 0:04:28.189,0:04:31.310
 it was always going to be in a tight
 0:04:29.449,0:04:33.319
 game but now all of a sudden one team
 0:04:31.310,0:04:37.129
 ahead things have got to change on both
 0:04:33.319,0:04:38.660
 sides well let's see that strike again
 0:04:37.129,0:04:42.289
 first time you
 0:04:38.660,0:04:44.089
 very difficult to strike a ball
 0:04:42.289,0:04:45.649
 technique has to be right but above all
 0:04:44.089,0:04:47.300
 you have to concentrate on the borns
 0:04:45.649,0:04:48.580
 it's coming to you you know you're not
 0:04:47.300,0:04:51.840
 going to take a clutch
 0:04:48.580,0:04:51.840
 concentration is everything
 0:04:59.330,0:05:03.009
 the opening gun of the game then

 0:15:01.730,0:15:06.860
 bit too much for players one side has to
 0:15:04.160,0:15:08.420
