 [Music]
 0:00:05.990,0:00:12.389
 and the warm welcome on what is an ideal
 0:00:09.660,0:00:14.340
 night for football you've got to say my
 0:00:12.389,0:00:16.800
 name is Derrick ray and I'm joined for
 0:00:14.340,0:00:19.199
 commentary by Lee Dixon and what we have
 0:00:16.800,0:00:22.109
 to look forward to is the second leg of
 0:00:19.199,0:00:24.600
 this Champions League semi-final bleep
 0:00:22.109,0:00:26.490
 this ought to be special well direct my
 0:00:24.600,0:00:28.920
 suggestion is you play the game as if
 0:00:26.490,0:00:31.679
 it's all square if you start to protect
 0:00:28.920,0:00:33.870
 a small margin too much this game can
 0:00:31.679,0:00:36.410
 run away from you I'm really looking
 0:00:33.870,0:00:36.410
 forward to this
 0:00:37.250,0:00:44.750
 [Music]
 0:00:40.670,0:00:48.070
 [Applause]
 0:00:44.750,0:00:48.720
 [Music]
 0:00:48.070,0:01:19.490
 [Applause]
 0:00:48.720,0:01:41.839
 [Music]
 0:01:19.490,0:01:41.839
 [Applause]
 0:01:41.939,0:01:47.549
 the line up there in the fort of the
 0:01:43.590,0:01:50.100
 hosts and they are a team Lee known for
 0:01:47.549,0:01:52.310
 the aggressive high pressing absolutely
 0:01:50.100,0:01:55.079
 that takes a lot of hard work a lot of
 0:01:52.310,0:01:57.209
 organization force your position to make
 0:01:55.079,0:01:59.700
 early passes the weakness of it if you
 0:01:57.209,0:02:02.270
 beat the high press you can get exposed
 0:01:59.700,0:02:02.270
 in the back
 0:02:06.460,0:02:11.860
 for Olympic Leon air it looks like this
 0:02:08.530,0:02:14.200
 Anthony Lopez begins in goal Marcel
 0:02:11.860,0:02:17.140
 starts with Kenny get it in the fallback
 0:02:14.200,0:02:19.660
 positions Luca to sob plays with who SEM
 0:02:17.140,0:02:22.030
 Awad in central midfield and they line
 0:02:19.660,0:02:24.630
 up with just the one striker looking to
 0:02:22.030,0:02:24.630
 do a bit of damage
 0:02:30.760,0:02:33.599
 Khedira
 0:02:34.130,0:02:38.960
 it's with Gonzalo higua√≠n
 0:02:36.830,0:02:41.470
 in a position from which they could
 0:02:38.960,0:02:44.410
 potentially do a bit of damage here
 0:02:41.470,0:02:49.930
 delete
 0:02:44.410,0:02:52.739
 now Matt Sweeney peonage Matt sweetie
 0:02:49.930,0:02:52.739
 Jannik
 0:02:52.790,0:02:58.069
 it is the perfect stage for a top player
 0:02:55.370,0:03:01.189
 and this man takes every game very
 0:02:58.069,0:03:05.120
 seriously he's out forgot versus blended
 0:03:01.189,0:03:07.740
 ball from Ronaldo Macau it is and what a
 0:03:05.120,0:03:10.180
 significant one
 0:03:07.740,0:03:12.350
 [Applause]
 0:03:10.180,0:03:15.950
 an extra time
 0:03:12.350,0:03:17.870
 possibility while the keeper have been
 0:03:15.950,0:03:19.550
 frustrated he thought he'd saved it was
 0:03:17.870,0:03:19.840
 so unlucky there is a good angle from
 0:03:19.550,0:03:23.200
 him
 0:03:19.840,0:03:26.849
 well what is in the packet in it
 0:03:23.200,0:03:26.849
 a chance to revisit the goal
 0:03:31.210,0:03:36.409
 [Applause]
 0:03:44.660,0:03:49.690
 so 1 1 it is on aggregate
 0:03:52.540,0:03:55.690
 [Applause]
 0:03:56.569,0:04:00.700
 take some progress with the ball of his
 0:03:58.489,0:04:00.700
 feet
 0:04:01.720,0:04:07.209
 [Applause]
 0:04:07.970,0:04:13.900
 and trust in their and no-nonsense
 0:04:10.940,0:04:17.440
 defensive clearance
 0:04:13.900,0:04:17.440
 here's Ronaldo
 0:04:17.829,0:04:30.900
 Alexandra now Cristiano Ronaldo godina
 0:04:24.190,0:04:37.479
 Alexandra now Khedira pianist
 0:04:30.900,0:04:41.849
 dibala Khedira Alexandra Khedira
 0:04:37.479,0:04:41.849
 Jannik Matuidi
 0:04:42.230,0:04:48.910
 on the run a good one has been made by
 0:04:44.330,0:04:48.910
 Matsui D losing possession here
 0:04:51.510,0:04:59.690
 it's worth Tucson on the ball massage
 0:04:55.190,0:04:59.690
 lovely weighted ball they might be in
 0:04:59.969,0:05:05.749
 and teammates to play it too
 0:05:02.479,0:05:07.939
 that's clear well Derek is so finely
 0:05:05.749,0:05:09.930
 balanced you just wonder if set pieces
 0:05:07.939,0:05:23.569
 will be the difference today
 0:05:09.930,0:05:26.240
 [Applause]
 0:05:23.569,0:05:29.029
 and overcomes the corner high-class
 0:05:26.240,0:05:31.630
 goalkeeping perfect positioning really
 0:05:29.029,0:05:35.680
 top-class goalkeeping brilliant safe
 0:05:31.630,0:05:35.680
 [Applause]
 0:05:36.670,0:05:40.140
 Cristiano Ronaldo
 0:05:40.750,0:05:49.390
 here's Reynaldo Alexandra now
 0:05:46.080,0:05:49.390
 [Applause]
 0:05:49.990,0:05:55.970
 so now that
 0:05:51.930,0:05:55.970
 he's got the right idea with that pass
 0:05:57.580,0:06:10.480
 [Applause]
 0:06:27.500,0:06:30.700
 it's worth to saw
 0:06:32.470,0:06:36.840
 ha
 0:06:34.570,0:06:39.360
 [Applause]
 0:06:36.840,0:06:45.020
 Tiago Mendez
 0:06:39.360,0:06:45.020
 Cristiano Ronaldo big wine
 0:06:45.700,0:06:51.330
 teni a is with Allah
 0:06:49.860,0:06:54.020
 and you've got to keep the ball a bit
 0:06:51.330,0:06:54.020
 better than that
 0:06:57.340,0:07:04.420
 it continues to make hay and the cross
 0:07:00.040,0:07:08.840
 is very much on Alexandra waiting at the
 0:07:04.420,0:07:12.120
 farmers Gonzalo higua√≠n anti-god
 0:07:08.840,0:07:12.900
 accuracy with the header just what they
 0:07:12.120,0:07:21.930
 need
 0:07:12.900,0:07:24.690
 [Applause]
 0:07:21.930,0:07:27.090
 we put some super balls in from the wide
 0:07:24.690,0:07:31.520
 areas and that one's probably the best
 0:07:27.090,0:07:33.740
 and what did they get reward a goal
 0:07:31.520,0:07:36.160
 the goal again albeit from a different
 0:07:33.740,0:07:36.160
 angle
 0:07:55.409,0:07:59.689
 one is the aggregate lead 
 0:08:08.470,0:08:13.260
 wonderful challenge the throw-in coming
 0:08:11.140,0:08:13.260
 up
 0:08:13.350,0:08:17.660
 [Applause]
 0:08:16.050,0:08:20.849
 Tiago Mendez
 0:08:17.660,0:08:20.849
 [Applause]
 0:08:21.870,0:08:26.870
 is with our others to play it too
 0:08:29.320,0:08:35.169
 Matuidi racing forward trying to catch
 0:08:32.380,0:08:38.620
 them out on that break looked so
 0:08:35.169,0:08:40.780
 promising but nothing coming from it -
 0:08:38.620,0:08:43.100
 sorry
 0:08:40.780,0:08:45.440
 we've been waiting to find out now we
 0:08:43.100,0:08:47.650
 know a minimum of three added minutes
 0:08:45.440,0:08:47.650
 here
 0:08:49.560,0:08:54.870
 teammate in support that was fired
 0:08:52.290,0:08:56.760
 straight up Nikita no real difficulties
 0:08:54.870,0:08:58.680
 for him no decent position from the
 0:08:56.760,0:09:01.860
 goalkeeper poor shot to be honest beer
 0:08:58.680,0:09:02.370
 and so it is the first half story has
 0:09:01.860,0:09:09.970
 been rated
 0:09:02.370,0:09:09.970
 [Applause]
 0:09:25.450,0:09:32.470
 [Music]
 0:09:36.460,0:09:41.370
 thus a splendid ball from Ronaldo
 0:09:39.380,0:09:44.820
 [Applause]
 0:09:41.370,0:09:47.190
 Hanako it is and what a significant one
 0:09:44.820,0:09:51.140
 they're locked together again he just
 0:09:47.190,0:09:51.140
 can't burn Aldo
 0:09:51.170,0:09:56.600
 [Applause]
 0:09:57.760,0:10:00.970
 [Music]
 0:10:03.270,0:10:10.980
 Alexandra
 0:10:06.250,0:10:10.980
 waiting at the far post Gonzalo higua√≠n
 0:10:11.480,0:10:17.740
 and the goal here accuracy with the
 0:10:15.170,0:10:29.019
 header just what they need
 0:10:17.740,0:10:32.959
 [Music]
 0:10:29.019,0:10:35.449
 and they're underway in the second half
 0:10:32.959,0:10:39.249
 of this Champions League semi-final
 0:10:35.449,0:10:39.249
